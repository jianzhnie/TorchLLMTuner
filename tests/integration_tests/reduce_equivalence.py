"""Semantics of ``accelerator.collectives.all_reduce`` and its call convention.

The historical regression: ``train_step`` reduces the local token count, then
divides the loss by *that same tensor* to get the per-rank average. With an
in-place reduce and no clone, the tensor the division read held the *global*
count, and a per-rank mean silently became a global one. Nothing failed --
``max_loss`` was just wrong, and only in the metrics dict: stdout prints
``loss`` and ``grad_norm``, never ``max_loss``.

These checks validate the collective itself (sum/max over a mesh group, dtype
handling) and demonstrate the call convention -- clone before the in-place
reduce when the argument is read afterwards. The load-bearing clone in
production lives inline in ``trainer.py`` (``global_valid_tokens = ...clone()``)
and is protected by code review, not by this file: the checks here clone in
the test body, so they cannot fire on a missing clone there.

Run under torchrun:

    torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 tests/integration_tests/reduce_equivalence.py

Two ranks are required. A mutation is invisible over a size-1 group, because
every rank reads back the same values anyway -- which is exactly why the
existing single-process checks passed throughout.
