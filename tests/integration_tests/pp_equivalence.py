"""PP>1 check: a split pipeline must train like the unpipelined model.

Run under torchrun with 2 ranks, one schedule per invocation:

    torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 tests/pp_equivalence.py            # 1F1B
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 tests/pp_equivalence.py Interleaved1F1B
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 tests/pp_equivalence.py ZBVZeroBubble

A tiny offline qwen3 (random init, fixed seed) goes through the real
``Trainer`` with ``pp=2``, 4 micro-batches per step, for 4 optimizer steps,
under either a single-stage schedule (1F1B: one stage per rank), a looped
one (Interleaved1F1B: two virtual stages per rank, over a deeper model so
every stage holds at least one layer), or a V-block one (ZBVZeroBubble: two
stages per rank, paired front-to-back so rank 0 holds the first AND the last
stage). The loss on the rank holding the last stage must track, step for
step, a reference computed on the whole model with no pipeline.

What the reference is, and why it is not just the ``pp=1`` trainer: the
trainer's non-PP body flattens the whole batch into ONE causal sequence, while
the PP body runs each micro-batch as its own sequence (pipeline stages are
separate forward calls; attention cannot cross a micro-batch boundary). The
reference therefore applies the *same* row chunking on one process -- same
batches, same per-micro-batch summed CE, same clip and AdamW -- so any
divergence is attributable to the pipeline machinery (stage split, p2p
activations/grads, schedule, cross-stage grad-norm reduction), not to a
different attention pattern.

Non-vacuity: each rank must hold only its own stages' layers, and the per-rank
parameter counts must sum to the whole model's.

Everything runs in fp32 on CPU/gloo. The tolerance sits above the only
intended difference: the gradient norm is reduced per stage and combined,
which is a different floating-point summation order than one whole-model norm.
