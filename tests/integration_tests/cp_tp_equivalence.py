"""CP + TP at once: tp>1 and cp>1 must compose, and each axis must be real.

Run under torchrun with 4 ranks (tp=2 x cp=2):

    PYTHONPATH=. torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 \
        tests/integration_tests/cp_tp_equivalence.py

Why this file exists: CP and TP are coupled in four separate places and no
harness ran both axes at once, so every one of those couplings was unverified.

* ``apply.py`` splits ulysses' heads over ``tp * cp``, so the local head count
  is ``H / (tp * cp)`` -- not ``H / cp``.
* ``shard_batch_for_tp`` slices the *CP shard*, so a TP slice must land inside
  this rank's CP block rather than across the whole sequence.
* ``_allreduce_replicated_tp_grads`` sums the gradients of TP-replicated
  parameters (embedding, norms, head), which under CP are also CP-partial.
* The trainer's loss mesh is ``(dp, cp, tp)``, while the denominator is a
  dp-only sum of the *unsharded* batch's token count.

Two levels of comparison, both in float64 so the difference is arithmetic
rather than noise:

* over ``tp``: the local slices join back to this rank's CP block, which must
  equal the reference's logits for exactly those tokens.
* over ``cp``: the CP blocks join back to the full sequence, which must equal
  the single-rank full-sequence reference.

That the first holds is what proves TP sliced *inside* the CP shard; if the
two axes sliced the sequence independently the join would not reproduce the
reference block. It also covers the ulysses strategy, whose kernel converts
back to token shards before returning, so both strategies present the same
externally-visible layout.

Non-vacuity, asserted rather than assumed: ``apply_tp`` must have swapped at
least one projection for a sharded realizer, and each CP rank past the first
must attend over more than its own block (a skipped K/V gather), and the token
count must be replicated on both axes rather than sharded.

The ``tp * cp`` head coupling is stated as an assertion of its own: with
``heads=8`` and ``tp*cp=4`` ``apply_cp`` must accept, and with ``heads=6`` (not
a multiple of 4) it must refuse.

The flex backend is forced explicitly: this machine has no CUDA and the
wrapper would otherwise select sdpa, which ``apply_cp`` rejects.
