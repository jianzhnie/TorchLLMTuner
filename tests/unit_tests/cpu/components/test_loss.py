"""The loss functions: pinned against an independent reference, not themselves.

`cross_entropy_loss` is exercised end-to-end in `test_trainer.py`, but always in
terms of itself -- a test that compares the sharded path to the plain path would
pass even if both were wrong the same way. These tests instead check each
function against the `torch.nn.functional` call it is supposed to be, which is
the only thing that pins the *value* rather than the *agreement*.

The vocab-parallel selection is deliberately shape-driven (`pred.shape[-1] !=
global_vocab_size`), so the tests that matter are the ones proving the plain
path is taken when it should be -- a mis-selected path that happens to also
return a sum would be invisible otherwise.
