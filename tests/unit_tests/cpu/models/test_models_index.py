"""The ``models.common`` index: lazy, complete, and honest about a miss.

The index exists so a caller can say ``from llmtuner.models.common import MoE``
without knowing the node layout. What it must *not* do is make that convenience
cost an import: an eager index drags the MoE stack (and the fused QKV
projection's ``DTensor``) into every consumer, including the ones that only
wanted a mask helper -- which on a torch build without those is the difference
between working and not importing at all. The lightness check therefore runs in
a subprocess (module state is process-global) while the rest is plain attribute
inspection.
