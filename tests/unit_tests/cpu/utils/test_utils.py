"""Pure-function edges: vocabulary sharding, target shifting, coalesced IO.

These are the pieces that a training run calls constantly but never *varies* --
the shapes that reach them depend on the config, and the configs the suite
already exercises are all well-formed. So the branches that decide what to do
with an empty shard, a ragged label stream, or a remote URI have no coverage
from the end-to-end tests no matter how many of those run.

Everything here is CPU-only and needs no process group; the pieces that do
(sharded cross-entropy) are covered in ``integration_tests/``.
