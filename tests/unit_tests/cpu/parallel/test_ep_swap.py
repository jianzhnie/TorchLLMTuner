"""The EP swap: a swapped-in llmtuner MoE must reproduce the HF block it replaced.

Single-process, CPU. ``tests/ep_wiring_equivalence.py`` covers the multi-rank
all-to-all; what this suite pins is the swap itself: weight movement, router
parity (softmax scoring, optional top-k renormalization), the refusal paths,
and the load-balance aux loss the swapped router carries.

Comparisons run in float64 where the model allows it. They are not exact: both
HF and llmtuner compute routing scores in fp32 (HF via ``softmax(dtype=float)``,
llmtuner's ``RouterGateLinear`` by construction), but HF computes the gate GEMM in
the model dtype while llmtuner computes it in fp32 -- so the scores agree only to
fp32 rounding. 1e-6 separates that noise floor (~5e-8) from a wiring error
(O(1)).

Every MoE config here requests ``experts_implementation="eager"``. transformers
5.x defaults to ``"grouped_mm"``, which dispatches the experts to
``torch._grouped_mm`` -- bf16-only, and unavailable on CPU entirely. The
auto-fallback to ``"eager"`` that normally saves a CPU run does not fire, because
``_grouped_mm_can_dispatch`` checks the device and the pointer alignment but
never the dtype, so a float32/float64 model passes the gate at ``from_config``
and then dies inside the first forward. Asking for ``"eager"`` explicitly gets
HF's per-expert ``F.linear`` loop, which is the same arithmetic form llmtuner's
``GroupedExperts`` falls back to -- so the two sides are comparable op for op,
which is what makes a bitwise assertion meaningful rather than merely close.

# for every family; in 4.x DeepSeek kept them on the router. The probe reads
# both locations, and ``test_deepseek_v3_routing_attributes_live_on_the_block``
# pins the fact so a future move shows up as a failure rather than as the probe
# quietly falling back.
#
# These run in float32 rather than float64: HF's own ``DeepseekV3MoE.moe``
# allocates its accumulator as ``torch.zeros_like(hidden_states,
# dtype=topk_weights.dtype)``, and ``topk_weights`` is fp32 on every path, so a
