"""Tests for the tensor-parallel declaration layer and engine wiring.

The fused collectives (``AllGatherLinear`` / ``LinearReduceScatter``) run only
on CUDA symmetric memory; the functional-collective fallback that lets TP run
on CPU needs a real process group, so the end-to-end forward/backward
equivalence lives in ``tests/integration_tests/tp_equivalence.py`` (torchrun).
What is testable single-process here is everything around the collectives: the
declaration, the weight layout each kind produces, plan resolution, the
loud-raise guards, and that ``apply_tp`` leaves a model alone when TP is off.
