"""PP per-stage seed derivation (llmtuner.trainer.builder).

trainer.py is not importable in a minimal CPU environment, so the derivation
lives in a dependency-free helper; these tests pin the seed semantics the
trainer relies on: distinct RNG streams per PP stage, reproducible per stage,
and bit-identical behavior when pp == 1.
