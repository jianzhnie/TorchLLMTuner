    defaults. The save set itself is not configurable (it is
    ``activation_checkpoint.get_default_save_ops``); these are the per-run
    knobs around it.

    Two deviations from upstream, both forced by what llmtuner runs:

    * ``force_recompute_mm_shapes_by_fqns`` defaults to empty rather than
      ``["moe.router.gate"]``. That default assumes the torchtitan ``Module``
      protocol, whose MoE routers are ``nn.Linear`` as ``moe.router.gate``. In
      HF models the router living at ``mlp.gate`` is a container (e.g.
      ``Qwen3MoeTopKRouter``), not a ``Linear``, so the pattern matches nothing
      on an HF MoE and the setting silently does nothing; on a dense HF model
      there is no router at all. Set it to a real ``*.q_proj``/``*.o_proj``
      style name to use it -- a pattern that matches a non-``Linear`` raises
      rather than being ignored, so a wrong guess is loud.
    * The shared save set drops ``aten.topk`` (see that function's docstring:
      HF's routers mutate topk's output in place, which torch's selective
      checkpoint rejects outright). The consequence is that a selective run
      over an HF MoE recomputes its topk and so inherits topk's
      non-determinism on kernels that have any.

    ``preserve_rng_state`` is separate from the flat argument on ``apply_ac``
    -- full and selective each carry their own, as upstream's policy classes
    do, because the two policies make different demands on the recompute's RNG.

    Ported from torchtitan's ``RegionAC.Config``: ``save_regions`` and

    globs relative to a transformer block, so one policy covers every block, and
    a recompute pattern wins over a save pattern -- and ``determinism_check``
    keeps upstream's default. What differs is where the region *names* come
    from. Upstream's own model code names them at ``torch_remat.region`` call
    sites (``attention.qkv``, ``feed_forward.w13``, ...) and
    ``Module.configure_remat_regions`` hands the patterns down. llmtuner runs HF
    models and does not own their decoder code, so the vocabulary is structural:
    every ``nn.Linear`` in a block is a region, named by its FQN relative to the
    block (``self_attn.q_proj``, ``mlp.gate_proj``, an MoE router's ``gate``).
    ``parallel/remat_regions.py`` explains why that is the same policy in HF's
    spelling, and what the vocabulary deliberately leaves out.

    Of the three knobs upstream's ``RegionAC.Config`` inherits from its policy
    base class, ``determinism_check`` carries over as it stands and ``debug`` is
    not exposed at all: ``torch_remat``'s checkpoint has no debug knob to forward
    it to (upstream only carries that field because the base class has it for the
    other policies). ``preserve_rng_state`` is kept, but can only stay ``False``
    -- ``torch_remat.checkpoint`` refuses ``True`` outright (a generator drawn
    inside a skipped save region would desync the recompute, and boundary-only
    stashing would hide that rather than fix it), and upstream's
    ``RegionAC.Config`` refuses it too, pointing at ``RecomputeStateHook``. The
    field is kept so that answer arrives at config-parse time, with that
    guidance, instead of from inside the library.

    Selecting the mode does not load ``torch_remat``: the package is imported
    when the policy is applied, so a config can name the mode on a machine that
    cannot run it.
