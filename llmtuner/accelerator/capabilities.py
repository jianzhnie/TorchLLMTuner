"""The capability registry: one place that answers "does this build have X?".

Torch-version and environment probes (``hasattr`` on private config modules,
guarded imports) used to be scattered across a dozen call sites, each
re-answering the same question its own way. They live here now, one named
entry per capability, each documented with what it is, which torch version or
package introduces it, and who consumes it. Probes are cached: the answer
cannot change within a process.

Use ``has(name)`` at a guard point, keeping the site's own error message (the
message text is a tested contract); ``require(name, feature=...)`` is the
convenience form for new code, raising ``EnvironmentUnsupportedError`` with
the entry's unlock hint. An unknown name raises immediately -- a typo must
not silently read as "capability absent".

Not everything import-shaped belongs here; see docs/torchllmtuner_design.md
§3.2. Optional *packages* (renderers, torchao, torchvision) keep raising
plain ``ImportError`` at their own sites. Device discovery
(``accelerator/device.py``) is availability probing with silent-absent
semantics, a different question. Hard imports with no fallback (DTensor,
flex_attention) have nothing to probe.
