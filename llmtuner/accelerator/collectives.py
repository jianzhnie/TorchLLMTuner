"""Collective operations, and gradient-norm clipping that respects the meshes.

The reductions and ``clip_grad_norm_`` are vendored from torchtitan
``distributed/utils.py``. What changed:

* The ``extra_pg`` argument is gone. torchtitan threads an extra process group
  through every reduction to reach ranks a mesh does not model (its odd-sized TP
  cases); llmtuner's meshes cover every rank, so the mesh argument is the whole
  addressing story.
* EP-aware clipping is adapted to llmtuner's physical expert partition: callers
  pass the exact local expert parameters plus the EP mesh. Dense parameters are
  counted once, while the p-th powers of local expert norms are reduced across
  EP ranks. This avoids upstream's requirement that every parameter be a
  DTensor carrying an explicit ``"ep"`` mesh axis.
* ``dist_sum`` / ``dist_max`` / ``dist_mean`` / ``dist_sum_tensor`` are not
  re-created. Upstream they are one-line ``funcol.all_reduce`` wrappers naming
  a reduction and its mesh; llmtuner's counterpart is this module's
  ``all_reduce`` (cast to the comm device + in-place c10d collective, vendored
  from mmengine's ``dist.all_reduce``), called at the site.
  ``trainer/trainer.py`` and ``trainer/validate.py`` reduce their loss/token
  denominators over ``dp_mesh`` / ``loss_mesh`` with it, and
  ``components/metrics.py`` reduces nothing at all (see its docstring), so
  there is no caller that would read better with a named helper. This also
  covers upstream's ``all_gather_entries`` and friends, which exist for
  bucketed per-module metrics llmtuner does not report.

The single non-obvious line kept from upstream is the ``DTensor`` branch in
``clip_grad_norm_``; it carries a comment explaining why it exists.

    parameter sets, so no single rank can see the full norm and each would clip
    against a different number. The PP norm is therefore reduced here first.

    Args:
        parameters: an iterable of tensors (or one tensor) to normalize.
        max_norm: max norm of the gradients. A non-positive value skips the clip
            but still returns the norm -- which is how the training loop reports
            ``grad_norm`` without paying for a clip nobody asked for.
        norm_type: type of the used p-norm. ``'inf'`` for infinity norm.
        error_if_nonfinite: throw if the total norm is nan/inf.
        foreach: use the faster foreach implementation (``None`` lets torch pick).
        pp_mesh: pipeline-parallel mesh; when present the norm is reduced across
            stages before clipping.
        ep_mesh: expert-parallel mesh. When present, only the norm contribution
            from ``expert_parameters`` is reduced over this mesh.
        expert_parameters: parameters physically partitioned across EP ranks.
            Required exactly when ``ep_mesh`` is provided.

    Returns:
        The total norm of the parameter gradients (viewed as one vector).

    NOTE: intentionally not ``torch.no_grad()`` -- ``get_total_norm`` must keep
    its autograd history so the clip's effect propagates. Do not add it.
