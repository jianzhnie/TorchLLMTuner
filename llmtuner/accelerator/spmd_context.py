"""Ambient SPMD mesh context: the bottom layer of llmtuner's SPMD helpers.

This module holds the only shared mutable SPMD state: a thread-local stack of
active meshes plus the registered dense/sparse meshes, and the by-name axis
queries that read them (``spmd_mesh_group`` / ``spmd_mesh_size``). It depends
on torch and the PyPI ``spmd_types`` package only, so ``models/common`` (and
the trainer) can ask "which process group is the TP axis?" without a reverse
dependency on the parallel layer. The trainer enters ``spmd_context`` once
per run; every other consumer reads the ambient state through the helpers
here.

    This is the one place the ambient SPMD state is entered. Everything
    downstream that asks "which process group is the TP axis?" -- the MoE token
    reduction, the vocab-parallel embedding, the fused dist-GEMMs -- reads it
    from here rather than receiving a mesh through its arguments, which is what
    keeps a ``DeviceMesh`` from having to thread through every model component.

    ``parallel_dims`` is a ``llmtuner.parallel.parallel_dims.ParallelDims``,
    duck-typed here as ``Any`` so this bottom layer never imports the parallel
    layer it serves.

    Two pieces of state, and both are required:

    * ``set_spmd_meshes`` registers the dense and sparse meshes so
      ``spmd_dense_mesh`` / ``spmd_sparse_mesh`` can answer. The sparse mesh is
      ``None`` unless EP is on, and ``None`` there reads as "no EP axis".
    * ``set_current_spmd_mesh`` pushes onto the mesh stack, which is what the
      by-name lookups (``spmd_mesh_group`` / ``current_spmd_mesh``) read.
      It also enters ``spmd_types.set_current_mesh``, so a model that wants
      *static* SPMD type checking gets a live mesh too.

    Without the second one the first is inert: the registry would hold a mesh
    that no lookup consults, and every caller would keep taking its "no mesh"
    branch -- the exact silent degradation this exists to remove.

    ``parallel_dims is None`` is the single-process case: there is no process
    group and no axis, so every lookup below correctly answers ``None``/``1``.
