"""Device probes, coloured output, and hardware peak throughput.

These are the pieces ``components/metrics.py`` needs in order to describe the
machine it is running on, kept out of that module because they are about the
hardware rather than about metrics.

Ported from torchtitan's ``tools/utils.py``, narrowed to the probes llmtuner
actually uses. Two departures:

* **One device type, decided once.** torchtitan resolves ``device_type`` with
  ``torch._utils._get_available_device_type()`` and then reaches for ``torch.xpu``,
  ``torch.neuron`` and friends at the point of use. llmtuner resolves its
  accelerator device in ``accelerator/device.py`` (NPU/CUDA/MLU/MUSA; see the
  note there on why MPS is excluded) and everything else stays out. A probe
  for a device this package cannot train on is a branch nothing can exercise.

* **No ``subprocess`` for ``lspci``.** torchtitan shells out to ``lspci`` to
  recover a fuller H100 variant string (NVL / PCIe / SXM), because
  ``get_device_name`` reports only "NVIDIA H100". llmtuner does not: shelling out
  from a training process is a side channel that can hang or fail in containers,
  and the probe buys nothing on a machine where the GPU is not an H100. The
  variant-less name selects the SXM figure, which is what the comment in
  ``get_peak_flops`` already calls the default.

* **The memory-history probes live here too.** They are the same kind of thing
  (a question about the machine) and they carry the same trap: they must be
  called on the device module, not on ``torch``. See :func:`record_memory_history`.
