"""A thin wrapper that plugs a HuggingFace model into a training loop.

This is the whole model layer: build a HF ``ForCausalLM`` from its config, give
the training loop a uniform ``(tokens, positions) -> logits`` entry point, and
expose the decoder's parts under the names the rest of the framework expects
(``tok_embeddings`` / ``layers`` / ``norm`` / ``lm_head`` / ``rotary_emb``).

Deliberately thin. An earlier version of this file (torchtitan's
``experiments/transformers_modeling_backend/model.py``) carried a 230-line
monkey-patch of ``PreTrainedModel._init_weights`` that re-derived every weight
with torchtitan's depth-scaled scheme, plus a ``PretrainedConfig`` subclass that
synced torchtitan and HF attribute names. Both existed to make checkpoints
bit-compatible with torchtitan's native models. llmtuner trains HF models with
HF's own initialization, so neither is needed -- ``from_config`` produces a
fully initialized model and that is the one we train.

What replaces them is per-forward work the HF model does not do on its own:

* attention is routed through flex attention so packed-document masking can be
  expressed (see ``get_attention_masks``),
* RoPE is driven by explicit ``positions`` rather than an ``arange``, because
  packed samples reset their positions at each document boundary.

Forward shape: this wrapper is a *decoder wrapper*, not a CausalLM. It runs the
decoder and applies ``lm_head`` itself, so ``self.model.model`` is the bare text
stack. Callers pass flat ``(T,)`` token and position tensors; the batch dim is
added and removed internally. ``forward(..., skip_lm_head=True)`` returns the
hidden states instead, for the trainer's chunked-loss path.

        architecture's input contract, and one of them needs the full-length
        positions that only exist before the sequence is sharded.

        1. **Normalize the batch shape.** The two loaders disagree about what a
           batch is -- the synthetic one yields ``(B, T)`` rows of one document
           each, a Grain one a flat packed stream -- so they are reconciled
           here. ``num_valid_tokens`` is *not* read: the trainer pops it before
           this call, because the loss denominator has to be the pre-shard count
           and reduced across DP before the first backward.
        2. **Collapse the batch dim**, turning ``(B, T)`` into the flat ``(B*T,)``
           the forward takes.
        3. **Build the attention mask**, when the batch carries ``positions``.
           This has to happen before step 5: the document structure of a packed
           batch is a global property, so the mask is built over the FULL
           sequence and only then Q-sharded.
        4. **Shard for context parallelism**, positions included, so RoPE
           follows each token to its rank.
        4b. **Shard for tensor parallelism** (sequence parallelism): the fused
           TP GEMMs all-gather the sequence inside each projection, so the
           forward must be entered holding only this rank's ``T / tp`` slice --
           otherwise the gather concatenates ``tp`` copies of the full sequence
           and every sharded weight gradient comes out ``tp`` times too large.
           Only the token-carrying tensors (``inputs``, ``labels``) are cut:
           after the in-projection gather, attention and RoPE see the assembled
           sequence (the CP shard, or the full sequence with CP off), so
           ``positions`` and the mask keep their CP/full length. This matches
           torchtitan's joint ``(CP, TP)`` sequence sharding
           (``hf_sharding.py``'s ``PartitionSpec(DP, (CP, TP), None)``): the CP
           shard composed with a contiguous TP slice of it is exactly the joint

        5. **Return the leftover dict as ``extra_kwargs``.** Those are splatted
           into ``forward``, so anything left here must be one of its keyword
           parameters -- ``positions``, ``attention_masks`` and
           ``padding_mask``, and nothing else.

        ``positions`` is optional: the synthetic source has none and the forward
        falls back to its own ``arange``, which is right for a single document
        but must not be relied on for a packed one. ``parallelism`` is accepted
        for signature parity with the reference but unused: llmtuner's CP
        load-balancer string is latched onto this wrapper by ``apply_cp`` (see
        ``set_cp_mesh``).

        The reference also takes ``max_num_documents``, to size a fixed-shape
        varlen mask for CUDA graph capture. It is not accepted here because
        there is no path for it to take: llmtuner's CP path goes through
        ``create_attention_mask`` (a flex ``BlockMask``), which rebuilds from
        the positions shard and takes no capacity bound, and the packing
        collator already caps segments at one row. Accepting it would mean a
        parameter the trainer passes and this method silently discards.

        Tensors arrive on the trainer's device; the trainer moves them before
        calling, so this is pure structure and stays device-free.
