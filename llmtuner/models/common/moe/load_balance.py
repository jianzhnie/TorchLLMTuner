"""The per-forward MoE load-balance loss.

One node of the ``moe`` package: ``MicrobatchWiseLoadBalanceLoss`` is the
DeepSeek-V3 sequence-wise auxiliary loss, run by a router on each training
forward through its ``aux_loss`` slot (the router owns the slot; this file owns
the loss). Corpus-level balance is the separate auxiliary-loss-free path in
``block.py``.

Vendored from torchtitan ``models/common/moe.py``. What changed: the
``spmd_types`` blocks are gone (no runtime effect), and the Partial -> Invariant
reduction is the ``PartialToInvariantAllReduce`` autograd Function (all-reduce
forward, identity backward) instead of ``spmd.redistribute`` -- the same
semantics, which ``torch.distributed.nn.all_reduce`` would NOT give: its
backward is a second all-reduce, multiplying the injected gradient by the group
size.

    """Per-forward MoE load-balance gradient (DeepSeek-V3 Sec 2.1.2 Eqs 17-20).

    The balancing unit is one forward's folded token stream (a DP-local
    microbatch). Global (corpus-level) balance is left to the
    auxiliary-loss-free bias path (``expert_bias_E``); this loss only
    discourages extreme load imbalance within individual forwards (samples),
    per the DeepSeek-V3 design ("Complementary Sequence-Wise Auxiliary Loss").

    With ``E`` experts, top-``K`` selection and ``T`` valid tokens per forward:

    Eq. 18: ``f_i = (E / (K T)) * sum_t 1[token t routes to expert i]``
    Eq. 19: ``p_i = (1 / T) * sum_t s'_t,i``, where
            ``s'_t,i = s_t,i / sum_j s_t,j`` is the per-token normalized score.
    Eq. 17: ``L_bal = sum_i f_i * p_i``

    The value returned through ``inject`` is ``T * L_bal``: Eqs 17-20 define a
    per-token-normalized value, while ``AuxLoss`` scales every auxiliary loss by
    ``1 / global_valid_tokens``, so the sum-type form keeps the injected weight
    at ``coeff * L_bal``.

    The counts (Eq. 18) and normalized-score sums (Eq. 19) are sums over the
    folded token dim, hence Partial over the mesh axes that shard it. They are
    all-reduced before the formula so every rank computes the same per-forward
    loss. The one-hot counts are non-differentiable: the gradient reaches the
    router only through the normalized-score sums and the top-k score carrier.

    ``T`` never appears explicitly: Eq. 18 is evaluated in the T-free form
    ``f_i = E * counts_i / sum_j counts_j``, which equals ``(E / (K T)) *
    counts_i`` because each token contributes K entries, so ``sum_j counts_j =
    K T``. That needs no shape or mesh-degree assumption and follows any
    masking the router applies to the routing map.

        coeff: scales the injected gradient, as for any ``AuxLoss``.
