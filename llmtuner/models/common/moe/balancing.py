"""MoE load-balancing hooks: the per-step expert-bias updates.

One node of the ``moe`` package: the sign-based bias update
(``register_moe_load_balancing_hook``) and the quantile-histogram update
(``register_moe_quantile_balancing_hook``), plus their reduction helpers.
Both are optimizer step pre-hooks over the MoE blocks ``iter_moe_layers``
finds; the blocks themselves live in ``block.py`` and the routers in
``router.py``.

    ``tokens_per_expert_E`` counted only the tokens *this* rank saw, so it is
    summed over every axis that shards one token stream before it means
    anything. Three collectives, for three different reasons:

    * ``dp`` -- each data-parallel rank processes a different slice of the
      batch, so the counts are partial over it. This is the one that matters
      for a plain FSDP run: without it every rank would balance its own shard
      and the biases would drift apart.
    * ``cp`` -- the sequence is split across the context-parallel ranks, so the
      tokens are partial there too.
    * ``tp`` -- only when EP is on: EP borrows ranks from TP, so the token
      stream is sharded over TP as well. Without EP every TP rank already sees
      the same full stream, so summing would multiply the counts by ``tp``
      (harmless for a sign-based step, but wrong for anything else reading it).

    Pipeline parallelism needs no collective here: it is a layer split, not a
    token split, so each stage's blocks see their own whole token stream.

    The expert dimension is deliberately *not* reduced. ``tokens_per_expert_E``
    is the global per-expert count -- the routing map spans all ``E`` experts on
    every EP rank, before the dispatcher narrows anything to a local shard -- so
    an EP all-reduce would double-count.

    Because every rank ends up with identical counts, the identical update is
    applied identically and ``expert_bias_E`` stays replicated, which is what
    the forward assumes.
