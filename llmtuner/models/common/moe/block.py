"""The MoE block itself: route, dispatch, compute, combine, sum.

Vendored from torchtitan ``models/common/moe.py`` -- the ``MoE`` block and the
walk that finds the blocks of a model. The rest of that upstream file lives
next to this one: the routers in ``router.py``, the expert weights in
``experts.py``, the EP dispatchers in ``dispatcher.py``, the balance loss in
``load_balance.py``, the bias-update hooks in ``balancing.py``.

What changed from upstream:

* the nested ``Config`` dataclass is gone; the block is constructed directly.
* the auxiliary-loss-free bias is updated by ``MoE.update_expert_bias``,
  registered as an optimizer step pre-hook (``balancing.py``, wired by the
  trainer builder) -- torchtitan reaches the same state through its own hook.
  The rule is the same sign-based, mean-centred nudge, and the counter is
  drained there; the reduction over the axes that shard a token stream is
  ``balancing.py``.
* the block is balancing-scheme-agnostic: a quantile router is driven by
  ``balancing.py``'s quantile hook instead, and the bias buffer is registered
  for it here (upstream needs a ``KimiLatentMoE`` subclass to do that). The two
  schemes cannot both own the buffer, which the constructor enforces.
* ``padding_mask`` (true for padding) is a staged per-microbatch input. It never
  changes the routing decision, the dispatch, or the expert compute -- those run
  on the full token stream. It filters only the load-balancing *statistics*:
  ``tokens_per_expert_E`` and the aux loss's f/p terms count valid tokens only,
  while the no-mask path is unchanged.

Shape legend, scoped to this file: ``T`` = tokens, ``D`` = model dimension,
``E`` = experts, ``K`` = experts per token (top-k).
