"""Auxiliary-loss gradient injection and distributed metric collection.

Vendored from torchtitan ``models/common/aux_loss.py``. What changed:

* The ``Module`` protocol and its ``Config`` carrier are gone; ``AuxLoss``
  takes its coefficients as keyword args, and ``_init_self_buffers`` (a
  meta-device build hook) is dropped.
* ``torch_remat`` is gone. Upstream wraps the accumulation in a
  ``remat.region(..., recompute=False)`` so ``torch_remat``'s activation
  checkpointing retains the region instead of replaying the side effect. llmtuner
  does not depend on ``torch_remat``, so the accumulation is simply inline. The
  injected gradient is unaffected; what changes is that under *any* activation
  checkpointing the forward is replayed and the logged metric counts the
  microbatch once per replay. Treat the logged value as a relative signal under
  checkpointing, not an absolute one.
* The ``spmd_types`` blocks are gone. ``spmd_assert_type`` on the injection's
  output described a placement the framework already inferred.
* ``OptimizersContainer`` becomes a plain ``torch.optim.Optimizer`` (llmtuner's
  trainer owns one directly) and ``ParallelDims`` is llmtuner's.

Design, unchanged from upstream:

Normalization: every auxiliary loss is scaled by the step's global valid-token
count (``set_step_denominator``), the same denominator the main loss uses, so
contributions stay comparable across parallelism degrees. The per-step metric
is the mean over loss instances (layers) of that scaled value, summed over
data-parallel ranks and pipeline stages.

The metric accumulates during the model forward. A step pre-hook rolls the
per-instance accumulators into ``group_acc`` registers, and
``collect_aux_loss_metrics`` reduces those for logging.
