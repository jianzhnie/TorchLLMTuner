"""The model vocabulary, shared across architectures.

Vendored from torchtitan ``models/common/``: the pieces an HF text model is put
together from, with nothing in here knowing which family it belongs to. The two
families big enough to need more than one file are subpackages -- ``attention/``
(the fused QKV projection, the mask builders) and ``moe/`` (router, experts,
dispatcher, block, balance loss, balancing hooks) -- and the rest are one node
per file: ``activation``, ``async_linear`` (TP-overlapped GEMMs), ``aux_loss``
(the gradient carrier), ``cast_linear``, ``embedding``, ``feed_forward``,
``linear``, ``multimodal``, ``rope``, ``scatter_add``.

Two conventions this package depends on:

* **Import from the leaf module, not from here.** The index below is a
  convenience for callers that want several nodes at once (and the discoverability
  surface); the leaf modules never import each other through it.
* **One module per component family.** A component with real behavior of its own
  belongs in its own file (as ``activation.py`` does for the gated activations)
  rather than being folded into a grab-bag module.

The index is **lazy** (``__getattr__``, PEP 562): naming a node here must not
import it. An eager version would make ``import llmtuner.models.common.rope``
pull in the MoE stack, the fused QKV projection and the rest -- and on a torch
build without ``DTensor`` or flex attention that is the difference between "a
mask helper is importable" and "nothing in this package is".
