"""Batch handling for the trainer: data loading, accounting, preprocessing.

Split out of ``trainer.py`` (batch 4b): the dataloading-axis helpers, the
loader construction and fetch wrapper, the token counting, and the
device-move / preprocess seam. These are module-level functions whose first
parameter stays named ``self`` -- the bodies moved here verbatim and
``Trainer`` keeps same-named thin delegates, so call sites, tests and the
monkeypatch surface are unchanged. Everything they read (``cfg``,
``parallel_dims``, ``metrics``, ``ntokens_seen``, ...) stays on the trainer.
