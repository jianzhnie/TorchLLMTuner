"""Pipeline-parallel step machinery, extracted from ``trainer.py``.

Microbatch row-splitting (``pp_microbatches``) and the schedule-driving
forward/backward body (``pp_forward_backward_body``) live here; the trainer
keeps same-named thin delegates so call sites and tests are unchanged. The
first parameter stays named ``self`` -- the bodies moved verbatim and keep
reading the trainer's ``pp_schedule`` / ``pp_has_*`` / ``_pp_loss_sentinel``
state, which is built in ``Trainer.__init__`` and stays there.

        Rows are split, never tokens: each micro-batch is collapsed with the

        documents and its loss is the same summed CE. Divisibility is enforced
        at setup (``apply_pp``), so ``chunk`` never leaves a short final piece.

        The split happens here rather than inside ``preprocess_inputs``, which
        is a deliberate divergence from the reference: torchtitan's protocol
        returns a *list* of micro-batches, but llmtuner's PP path row-chunks one
        batch after the model has already collapsed it, and splitting inside the
        model would make every other caller of that method carry a batch dim it
        does not want. Keeping the loop holding rows also means the model's

        Only the first stage is handed the inputs (``arg_mbs``) and only the
        last the labels (``target_mbs``); intermediate stages receive the
        previous stage's activations over the schedule's p2p channel. Every
        stage preprocesses its own micro-batches, because a non-first stage's
        chunk holds hidden states rather than token ids and only the model knows
        which of the two it is looking at.

        The schedule's loss is the same summed next-token CE the non-PP body
        computes (``pipeline_parallel/apply.py:scalar_loss_fn``), so the return
        keeps the caller's normalization unchanged: the sum over the last
        stage's micro-batches. That sum is over the last stage's *own* shard of
        the sequence, which is why the caller's denominator -- counted before
        the sequence was cut up -- is the right one.

        ``global_valid_tokens`` reaches the loss function before the
        schedule's backward -- through ``loss_kwargs`` on the public ``step``,
        or the ``_llmtuner_global_valid_tokens`` schedule attribute on the
        private pre-split driver -- and it divides there. The losses the
        schedule reports are therefore sum/G, and they are multiplied back by
        G here so the caller keeps receiving the raw sum it normalizes and
        reports.

        The token count is not taken here: the caller needs it before the
        micro-batches are cut, and a stage's count would be over its own slice.
