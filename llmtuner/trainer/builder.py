"""Trainer assembly: everything between "a config" and "a trainer".

``Trainer.__init__`` is a thin shell -- it delegates here. This module owns
the assembly order, which is a contract:

1. process group + rank resolution, then degree resolution
   (``build_parallel_dims``) -- the PP seed offset below needs this rank's
   stage coordinate;
2. combination guards -- the support matrix (``llmtuner/parallel/matrix.py``)
   fires here: validation feasibility, chunked-loss x PP, EP x HF-initial-load
   (EP x checkpoint itself is supported since 2026-10, see
   ``parallel/expert_parallel/ckpt.py``);
3. deterministic seeding (before any model build);
4. the mesh (``build_mesh`` -- see ``llmtuner/parallel/parallel_dims.py``);
5. the model, then parallelism in stage-table order
   (``llmtuner/parallel/stages.py``, driven by ``parallelize_hf_transformers``);
6. optimizer, lr schedule, EMA, and the MoE aux/balance pre-hooks;
7. dataloader, checkpointer, metrics.

Each step consumes only the previous steps' products. Nothing here is a
runtime hot path; it runs exactly once per run.
