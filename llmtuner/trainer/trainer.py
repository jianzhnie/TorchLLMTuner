"""Trainer -- the single training loop, shared by every learning step.

Shape vendored from torchtitan ``trainer.py``: ``train`` -> ``train_step`` ->
``forward_backward_step`` -> ``_forward_backward_body``, one function per level
of the step, so each can be read and tested on its own. The distributed
complexity still lives in ``parallel/``; the loop is meant to read end to end.

What the migration added, and why each earned its place:

* **Token-normalized loss.** The loss is a SUM over predicted tokens divided by
  the token count reduced across DP. That makes the reported number independent
  of how the batch was split across ranks, and it is the precondition for
  gradient accumulation to sum correctly.
* **The denominator is a whole-batch property.** It counts the tokens of the
  *unsharded* batch -- before context parallelism slices it and before pipeline
  parallelism cuts it into micro-batches -- so it is the same number on every
  rank of the workload and for every micro-batch of a step, and it is reduced
  over the DP axis alone. Sharding the sequence must not change the reported
  loss, which is why the *loss* reduce-group is chosen differently: it follows
  the sequence, so it spans dp * cp whenever either is enabled.
* **Gradient accumulation.** ``gradient_accumulation_steps`` runs the
  forward/backward once per group and advances the optimizer once. The division
  happens *inside* each group's backward -- the group's summed loss over every
  group's token counts -- but the effective step length is the token count of
  the *whole* accumulation window. At ``gradient_accumulation_steps == 1`` the
  two coincide and every reading is the familiar per-batch one. Above 1 the
  gradients are consistent with a batch G times longer, so the reported loss
  converges to the true per-token loss while the window is still filling up.
  See ``train_step`` for the ordering.
* **Gradient clipping + ``grad_norm`` reporting.** ``clip_grad_norm_`` reduces
  the norm across PP stages before clipping, which ``torch.nn.utils`` cannot do
  because each stage holds disjoint parameters. The reported norm is therefore
  the norm of the *normalized* gradient, matching the reference: a config
  reporting 281 un-normalized reports ~0.56 once the loss is divided by the
  token count before backward.
* **A finiteness check**, reduced to one global flag across the loss and PP
  meshes. A NaN loss or gradient looked exactly like a healthy step: training
  continued and every later number was garbage. This stops at the first bad step
  instead, and does it with an on-device check so it neither synchronizes (unlike
  ``.item()``) nor becomes a CUDA-graph break.
* **Garbage collection on the training loop's schedule.** The cyclic collector
  is disabled process-wide and run at a step boundary instead, so it cannot fire
  mid-forward -- see ``utils/gc``.
* **Checkpoints**, so a run can be resumed rather than restarted. The loop only
  drives the manager (``components/checkpointer``) -- it decides *when* to save
  and load; the manager owns *how*, including the interval and retention
  policies. ``Trainer.state_dict``/``load_state_dict`` are what make the step
  and token counters part of the checkpoint.
* **Metrics**, reported through ``components/metrics`` rather than a bare
  ``logger.info``: the same loss and grad_norm, plus throughput, MFU and device
  memory, to stdout and optionally TensorBoard or WandB. The processor also owns
  the reporting frequency and the token/data-loading accounting, so the loop
  only has to call ``add_tokens`` and ``log``. ``n_tokens_seen`` -- the
  checkpointed cumulative count -- is logged alongside them, summed over the
  same group the loss average spans so it counts each token once.
* **A lowered process-group timeout once training is under way.** The groups
  are created with the long startup timeout, because that is what model build
  and the first collective genuinely need; ``train`` drops every one of them
  (plus the world group) to ``parallel.train_timeout_seconds`` after this
  process's first completed step, so a later hang is reported in seconds rather
  than mistaken for a slow launch -- see ``accelerator.collectives.set_pg_timeouts``.
* **Profiling**, through ``components/profiler``: ``Profiler`` is entered once
  around the loop and stepped once per iteration, so Kineto traces land on a
  schedule and allocator memory snapshots are written periodically -- plus one
  more if the run dies of an OOM, which is the one that is usually wanted.
* **Periodic validation**, ported from torchtitan's validator: an eval-mode,
  gradient-free pass over a fresh dataloader every ``validation.freq`` steps,
  reporting the summed loss over the *global* valid-token count reduced across
  DP -- the same normalization the training loss uses, so the two numbers are
  comparable. Opt-in via ``training.validation_config``; when it is ``None``
  the loop below is bit-identical to not having the feature. The pass updates
  no parameters and touches no checkpoint state. Zero batches and zero valid
  tokens are loud errors, not a silently skipped report, the configurations
  that cannot terminate cleanly (``steps=-1`` with DP > 1 or with the
  infinite random corpus) are rejected at build time, and chunked loss x
  validation is refused because the pass scores full logits. Under pipeline
  parallelism the pass drives the schedule's eval driver
  (``trainer/validate.py::validate_body_pp``).

``train_step``'s execution order follows torchtitan's and is load-bearing:
zero the gradients, snapshot the learning rate, read *every* batch the step
consumes, reduce the token count, run the forward/backward groups, clip, check
finiteness, wait for any in-flight checkpoint staging, step the optimizer and
then the scheduler, and only then normalize the loss for reporting. Steps whose
value must be identical across all the batches of a step -- the denominator and
the reported lr -- are taken before any of them is consumed.

What was NOT ported: torchtitan's component system (``model_spec``,
``sdc_replayer``, CUDA graphs). Those are infrastructure the loop
calls into, not loop logic, and llmtuner has no counterparts to call.

            Only the first stage is handed the inputs (``arg_mbs``) and only the
            last the labels (``target_mbs``); intermediate stages receive the
            previous stage's activations over the schedule's p2p channel. Every
            stage preprocesses its own micro-batches, because a non-first stage's
            chunk holds hidden states rather than token ids and only the model knows
            which of the two it is looking at.

            The schedule's loss is the same summed next-token CE the non-PP body
            computes (``pipeline_parallel/apply.py:scalar_loss_fn``), so the return
            keeps the caller's normalization unchanged: the sum over the last
            stage's micro-batches. That sum is over the last stage's *own* shard of
            the sequence, which is why the caller's denominator -- counted before
            the sequence was cut up -- is the right one.

            ``global_valid_tokens`` reaches the loss function before the
            schedule's backward -- through ``loss_kwargs`` on the public ``step``,
            or the ``_llmtuner_global_valid_tokens`` schedule attribute on the
            private pre-split driver -- and it divides there. The losses the
            schedule reports are therefore sum/G, and they are multiplied back by
            G here so the caller keeps receiving the raw sum it normalizes and
            reports.

            The token count is not taken here: the caller needs it before the
            micro-batches are cut, and a stage's count would be over its own slice.
