"""One implementation of the lazy package index (PEP 562) used across llmtuner.

Five ``__init__`` files here are *indexes*: each names a slice of its package's
public surface so that ``from llmtuner.accelerator import get_rank`` works,
while the submodule behind a name is imported only when that name is touched.
The laziness is load-bearing, not a style choice:

* ``llmtuner.accelerator`` has to stay importable where ``dist_utils.py`` is not;
* ``llmtuner.parallel`` is read by ``llmtuner.config``, which cannot pay for the
  engine layer (its context-parallel half pulls in the model stack);
* ``llmtuner.components.checkpointer`` guards a torch.distributed surface that
  older torch builds do not have;
* ``llmtuner.models.common`` must not drag the MoE stack into every consumer;
* ``llmtuner`` itself keeps ``Trainer`` -- and the whole ``torch.distributed``
  stack behind it -- out of ``import llmtuner``.

Each index keeps its own name -> submodule table; that table is the discoverable
thing. What is shared is the lookup, the error message and the ``__dir__`` sort,
which used to be copy-pasted into all five.
