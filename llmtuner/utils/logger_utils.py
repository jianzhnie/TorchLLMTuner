"""Colored distributed-aware logging with rank information.

llmtuner configures one stdout handler per module logger instead of touching the
root logger, so a module that wants its INFO lines on the console takes its
logger from ``get_logger`` here rather than from ``logging.getLogger``. The
rank decision is made by a filter *at emit time*, not when the logger is
created: engine modules are imported before ``init_dist``, when the real rank
is not knowable yet, so an import-time rank check would hand every rank a
rank-0 configuration.
