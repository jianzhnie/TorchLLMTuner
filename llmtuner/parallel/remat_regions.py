"""The region vocabulary ``RegionAC`` uses on HF decoder blocks.

Upstream torchtitan's ``RegionAC`` reads its region names off its own model code:
every ``torch_remat.region(...)`` call site there names a semantic unit
(``attention.qkv``, ``attention.inner_attention``, ``feed_forward.w13``,
``feed_forward.w2``), and ``Module.configure_remat_regions`` hands the block's
save patterns down to those call sites. llmtuner runs HF models and does not own
their decoder code, so the same idea is realized structurally instead: **every
``nn.Linear`` inside a decoder block is a region**, named by its FQN relative to
the block.

That is the upstream policy spelled in HF's vocabulary rather than a retreat
from it:

* upstream's ``save_regions`` examples name projections, and in HF those are
  exactly the ``nn.Linear``s -- ``self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj``,
  ``mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj``, and an MoE router's ``gate``;
* ``Linear.forward`` is ``forward(input) -> Tensor``, the flat
  tensor-in/tensor-out shape ``torch_remat.region`` requires of the callable it
  annotates (an arbitrary HF submodule may take and return nested structures,
  which that API walks only leniently);
* the regions are siblings, never nested, so they cannot reach torch_remat's
  "a recompute region inside a save region" error or its
  one-name-per-checkpoint-phase rule.

Not in the vocabulary, deliberately: packed expert weights (``GroupedExperts``
holds one stacked parameter, not a ``Linear``), attention's inner softmax (HF
gives it no module of its own), and the norms and activations -- cheap to
recompute, which is the whole point of the mode. A swapped-in llmtuner MoE
block's router gate *is* a ``nn.Linear``, so it stays a region.

Kept engine-free -- no ``torch_remat``, no ``apply_*`` import -- so the
vocabulary and the pattern rule can be imported, logged and tested without the
optional dependency, the way ``parallel/stages.py`` keeps the assembly order
engine-free.
