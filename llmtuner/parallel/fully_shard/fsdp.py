    llmtuner's HF models hold plain tensors, so ``fully_shard`` cannot take an
    explicit ``DataParallelMeshDims``: torch requires every parameter to be a
    DTensor on the full SPMD mesh in that mode ("When dp_mesh_dims is
    provided, all parameters must be DTensors ... via distribute_module").
    Without mesh dims, torch reads the mesh by shape alone: 1-D means plain
    FSDP, 2-D means HSDP (dim 0 replicates, dim 1 shards), and anything
    higher-dimensional raises. Handing FSDP the raw multi-axis storage mesh
    therefore mis-assigns the axes whenever that mesh also carries ``tp`` or
    more than two active axes.

    Instead, rebuild a dedicated submesh over exactly the axes torchtitan
    declares in its ``DataParallelMeshDims``:

    * shard: ``dp_shard`` (force-kept-alive in the dense storage mesh even at
      size 1, so pure DDP gets a well-defined HSDP shard axis) plus ``cp``
      when CP is enabled, flattened into a single axis when both are active
      (torchtitan's flattened shard semantics);
    * replicate: ``dp_replicate`` when replication is enabled.

    The result is at most 2-D with the replicate axis first, so torch's
    default reading coincides with the intended one. A size-1 result means no
    DP/CP axis is active and FSDP is a no-op; the caller checks for that.
