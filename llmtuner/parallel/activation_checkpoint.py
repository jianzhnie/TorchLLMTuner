"""Activation checkpointing: recompute each decoder layer during backward.

Vendored in shape from torchtitan's ``distributed/activation_checkpoint.py``.
All four of its policies are ported:

* ``"full"`` (upstream ``FullAC``) wraps each decoder layer in torch's
  non-reentrant ``checkpoint_wrapper``, so a forward keeps only the layer's
  inputs and recomputes its activations inside backward -- one extra forward
  per layer in exchange for the layer's activation memory. Upstream routes this
  through a selective checkpoint context carrying a constant
  ``PREFER_RECOMPUTE`` policy (``_full_ac_policy``), which is what lets torch
  still *save* an op whose output cannot be recomputed -- a registered effect --
  rather than replay it blindly; ``wrap_full``/``full_policy`` here are the same
  two pieces.

* ``"selective"`` (upstream ``SelectiveAC``) is per-op: a ``context_fn`` policy
  is asked about every op inside the layer and answers ``MUST_SAVE`` for the
  ones in the save set (``get_default_save_ops`` -- matmuls, SDPA and flex
  attention, and the collectives whose outputs are expensive to resend) and
  ``PREFER_RECOMPUTE`` for the rest. Matmuls in the save set are recomputed
  every second time instead of always, which is the memory/compute dial. One
  op is dropped from upstream's set; ``get_default_save_ops`` says which and
  why, and it is the one place that behavioural difference lives.

* ``"memory_budget"`` (upstream ``MemoryBudgetAC``) wraps nothing: it sets one
  process-global, ``torch._functorch.config.activation_memory_budget``, and
  the compile partitioner trades compute for memory inside each compiled
  region (0.0 is full-checkpointing memory, 1.0 the runtime-optimized
  default). It therefore only means anything when the model is compiled --
  selecting it with compile off is a config error, as upstream validates --
  and on a torch whose ``torch._functorch.config`` has no
  ``activation_memory_budget`` knob it refuses loudly rather than setting a
  global nothing reads. Upstream's ``visualize_memory_budget_pareto`` (an SVG
  dump into a trainer dump folder) is not ported; llmtuner's AC path has no
  dump folder.

* ``"region"`` (upstream ``RegionAC``) keeps the block's declared regions and
  recomputes the rest, using the optional ``torch_remat`` package (imported at
  apply time; it needs torch >= 2.10, so this mode is the one policy llmtuner
  cannot exercise on its development torch). Upstream gets its region names
  from ``torch_remat.region`` call sites in its own model code, wired by
  ``Module.configure_remat_regions``; HF models carry neither, so
  ``remat_regions`` derives the same vocabulary structurally -- the block's
  ``nn.Linear``s -- and ``wrap_region`` annotates them and then checkpoints the
  block's forward. ``wrap_region``'s docstring and ``remat_regions``' state the
  naming rules and what the vocabulary deliberately leaves out.

``"full"`` and ``"selective"`` use the same wrapper factory as upstream
(``torch.distributed.algorithms._checkpoint.checkpoint_wrapper``) and the same
``early_stop`` setting as upstream, which since upstream #4836 is the torch
default ``True``: the recompute stops as soon as every needed tensor is
produced instead of replaying the rest of the region. The old ``False`` was a
workaround for an upstream llama4 memory leak that no longer applies, and
carried a 1-4% step-time cost. ``"full"`` additionally keeps
``preserve_rng_state=True`` by default, so the recompute sees the RNG state
the original forward saw and the run stays bitwise-equal to the
uncheckpointed one. (``"region"`` wraps with ``torch_remat``'s own checkpoint
instead, which has no ``early_stop`` knob to set.)

Not ported, deliberately: upstream's RegionAC has no other moving parts. The
region *declaration* channel is the one piece llmtuner had to reinvent rather
than copy, because ``Module.configure_remat_regions`` presumes model code
llmtuner does not own; see ``remat_regions``.

Upstream's ``disable_dynamo_lru_cache`` IS ported, because the case it fixes
is reachable here: activation checkpointing applies on the ``pp > 1`` path too
(per stage chunk, upstream's ``ac_config``-per-model-part order). It is the
only place that touches that process-global knob, it runs only when a mode is
actually applied, and it is capability-guarded -- the knob is absent from the
torch 2.2.2 build this repo develops against, where the function logs and
returns instead of failing the run.

The remaining deviation from upstream is the entry point: torchtitan selects a
policy by instantiating an ``ActivationCheckpointing`` subclass, llmtuner by
passing a mode string (the extension point its config already documents).

def get_default_save_ops() -> set:
    """The ops whose activations ``"selective"`` saves rather than recomputes.

    Two sources, ported from upstream: torch's own list of compute-intensive
    ops (``get_default_op_list``), plus the explicit sets below. Each spec in
    those sets is either an op handle (always present) or a ``(root, dotted
    path)`` pair for an op that only exists in some builds -- resolved through
    ``getattr`` and skipped when it is not registered, so the same list runs
    against a CPU-only torch.

    The comm ops at the end are worth keeping pointed at even though llmtuner
    runs no DeepEP/HybridEP: they resolve-or-skip, so their absence is silent
    here while their presence (a future EP backend) is exactly when
    re-communication would be the thing to avoid.

    ``aten.topk`` is upstream's one deliberate omission. It saves topk because
    topk can be non-deterministic, so a recompute can pick different experts
    than the forward did. llmtuner cannot save it: HF's MoE routers normalize
    the values topk returns with an in-place divide (``router_top_value /=
    ...``), and torch's selective checkpoint raises "Tensor cached during
    selective activation checkpoint has been mutated" when a cached output is
    written afterwards -- on every MoE model, on any device. So a
    selective-AC run over HF MoE recomputes its topk and inherits the
    non-determinism: on a GPU whose topk kernel is not reproducible, the
    backward is then the gradient of a slightly different expert assignment.
    Expert assignment is a piecewise-constant partition of the scores, so a
    flip needs two experts to land on exactly equal scores; on CPU torches'
    topk is deterministic and the two runs agree bitwise (pinned by
    ``test_selective_ac_matches_uncheckpointed_bitwise_on_moe``).

    """Wrap every decoder layer of ``model`` in a checkpoint wrapper.

    No-op when ``mode == "none"`` (the model is handed back untouched), so the
    caller needs no mode check of its own.

    ``mode == "full"`` checkpoints the whole layer: its forward activations are
    dropped and recomputed during backward. ``preserve_rng_state`` is this
    mode's knob; the default restores the RNG state for the recompute, which is
    what keeps a full-AC run bitwise-equal to an uncheckpointed one.

    ``mode == "selective"`` needs ``selective``, the ``SelectiveACConfig``
    carrying that policy's settings (it has its own ``preserve_rng_state``, so
    the two modes never share one).

    ``mode == "memory_budget"`` wraps nothing: it needs ``memory_budget`` (the
    ``MemoryBudgetACConfig``) and ``compile_enabled=True``, and sets the
    process-global budget the compile partitioner later reads.

    ``mode == "region"`` needs ``region`` (the ``RegionACConfig``) and the
    optional ``torch_remat`` package, imported at apply time. It has no flat
    ``preserve_rng_state`` argument: torch_remat refuses ``True``, so the mode
    carries its own field, which can only stay ``False`` (see
    ``RegionACConfig``). Any other mode is a loud error.

    Apply after TP/EP/CP and before compile/FSDP (torchtitan's order in
    ``parallelize_llama``): the wrapper must enclose the TP-sharded layer, and
    FSDP has to wrap the checkpointed block so the recompute runs with
    all-gathered parameters instead of re-triggering the gather. For
    ``"memory_budget"`` the same call site is what guarantees the global is
    set before the compile it governs.
