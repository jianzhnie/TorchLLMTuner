"""The CP flex kernel: redistribute q/k/v across the CP group, then run flex.

``apply_cp`` attaches one of these to every decoder layer's attention module
as ``_titan_flex_kernel``; ``hf/model.py``'s ``flex_attention_hf`` routes the
layer's attention call through it. q/k/v arrive HF-shaped --
``(batch, heads, seq, dim)`` -- with the sequence already sharded along dim 2
by ``shard_batch_for_cp``. Two strategies redistribute them:

* ``"kv_allgather"`` all-gathers K/V along the sequence dim, so flex runs the
  local query shard against the full-length keys. Q and the output stay
  token-sharded.
* ``"ulysses"`` all-to-all's every input from a token shard into a head shard
  -- ``(b, h, s/cp, d) -> (b, h/cp, s, d)`` -- runs flex on the full sequence
  with ``heads / cp`` heads, then all-to-all's the output back. Compute and
  memory both shard, at the cost of two all-to-alls per layer.

Neither redistribution depends on an ambient SPMD context. The kv_allgather
gather is torch's own ``flex_cp_allgather`` custom op (the one torchtitan's
HF-backend ``_wrap_flex_kernel_cp`` uses), held by process-group name; the
ulysses all-to-alls drive ``all_to_all_single`` on the group itself. Both are
captured at attach time.

Masks under ulysses: attention runs on the FULL sequence, so a Q-sharded
BlockMask does not apply -- its Q axis is the local shard's length. Two mask
shapes therefore reach the kernel. For a single causal document the wrapper
hands over its Q-sharded CP mask (it builds one mask shape for every CP
strategy) and the kernel rebuilds the full-length causal mask itself -- exact
because that mask is a function of the sequence length alone. For a packed
corpus (``block_causal``) the wrapper hands over the full-length document mask
UNSHARDED: the all-to-all reassembles the whole token stream on every rank
before attention, so the document structure (the varlen metadata: which tokens
share a document) needs no sharding -- the same reason upstream's ulysses
``cp_shard`` lifts ``attention_masks`` out of the sharded inputs and reattaches
it untouched. The kernel tells the two apart by the mask's Q length (see
:meth:`CPFlexKernel._forward_ulysses`).
