"""Cross-layer combination verdicts: the single source for assembly/probe guards.

The support matrix's scope is the combinations that need MORE than the config
to decide -- assembly time (the model, the resolved ``ParallelDims``, the
dataset name) and probe time (the HF model's layout, via the EP swap's
duck-typed probes). Each is a plain function below plus one row in the
``ENTRIES`` table at the bottom: the function carries the verdict (exception
type, exact message) and the rationale (its docstring); the row records the
phase and the guard's location. The trigger condition stays at the guard
site; the verdict lives here, so the site cannot quietly disagree.

Config-phase combination checks are NOT here: they live in the owning
config's ``__post_init__`` (``config/parallel.py``, ``config/training.py``,
``config/root.py``), alongside every other field validation. The division of
labor is documented in docs/torchllmtuner_design.md (§3.3, the
combination-verdict section).

This is deliberately not a rules engine: plain functions, plus one flat
table. Field-level validation (sizes, allowed values) is not combination
knowledge and stays in the configs; capability probing (torch knobs) lives in
``accelerator/capabilities.py``.
