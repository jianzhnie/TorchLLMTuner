"""Pipeline parallelism: split the model, then build the schedule over it.

``pipeline.py`` (same package) computes the stage split; this module is the
driver around it, vendored in shape from torchtitan's
``distributed/pipeline_parallel.pipeline_llm``:

* ``apply_pp`` -- decides the stage count from the schedule class and splits
  the model into this rank's stages. Parallelizing the resulting chunks (TP,
  compile, FSDP) is the caller's job: ``parallelize`` owns that assembly
  order for both the split and the unsplit path, so this module never imports
  a sibling parallelism family. Its ``first_stage_module_fqns`` option is
  torchtitan's ``pipeline_with_first_stage_modules``: extra top-level modules
  co-located with stage 0 (see ``prepend_first_stage_modules``).
* ``build_pipeline_schedule`` -- instantiates the torch pipelining schedule
  over this rank's stages, with the summed next-token CE the trainer
  normalizes, wrapped down to the bare scalar a schedule requires.

What is not ported: the ``get_mesh`` callback (llmtuner passes plain tensors
across stage boundaries, never DTensors -- see ``pipeline.py``) and csv-loaded
runtime schedules, which are rejected rather than honored.
