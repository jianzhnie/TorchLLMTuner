"""One entry point that applies parallelism to a HuggingFace model.

Order matters, and it is the whole content of this file: TP / CP / EP are
declared first, activation checkpointing wraps each decoder layer next, then
``torch.compile``, and FSDP wraps last so its hooks sit outermost. The order
is not a comment -- it is the ``STAGES`` table in ``stages.py``, which both assembly
paths are driven by (the PP per-part path runs the ``on_pp`` subsequence).
Each ``apply_*`` is a no-op when its degree is 1 (or its mode off), so the
same call runs from a single device up to a full hybrid mesh.

PP is the exception to "one model in, one model out": with ``pp > 1`` the model
is cut into per-stage chunks first (``pipeline_parallel.apply_pp``), each chunk
then goes through TP / AC / compile / FSDP here in the same relative order as the
unsplit path, and the caller gets back a ``PipelineParallelSetup`` (stages,
chunks, schedule) instead of a model.

On provenance: this is the *orchestration* half of torchtitan's
``parallelize_hf_transformers``. The other half was three things; the first
two llmtuner deliberately does not do, and dropping them is a decision, not an
oversight:

* **Untying ``tok_embeddings`` from ``lm_head``.** torchtitan un-ties them
  because its FSDP cannot shard a parameter shared by two FSDP groups. llmtuner
  instead detects the tie (``HFTransformerModel.enable_weight_tying``) and
  shards the embedding, norm and head as one unit -- so untying here would
  silently train an un-tied model that no longer matches its HF checkpoint.
  Models with ``tie_word_embeddings=False`` (llama, qwen) are unaffected either
  way.
* **Converting modules to a ``Module`` protocol.** llmtuner has none, and no
  on-the-fly sharding-config declarations either -- the TP plan lives as plain
  data in the model registry instead (see docs/torchllmtuner_design.md, SEAM 1).
* **Swapping in a native MoE.** No longer true: ``apply_ep`` swaps HF MoE
  blocks for the ``models/common`` MoE stack when ``ep > 1`` (see
  ``parallel/expert_parallel/swap.py``). The swap moves weights rather than
  re-initializing them, so the model still trains from HF's initialization.

    ``compile``, ``activation_checkpoint``, ``selective_ac`` and

    explicitly rather than read off a run-wide config: this layer's contract is
    ``ParallelConfig`` plus the handful of scalars the guards actually need.
    ``compile_config`` tunes the compile step (per-block, backend, async TP);
    ``None`` is the plain whole-model compile.
    ``global_batch_size`` is required only on the ``pp > 1`` path (microbatch
    validation). Per-token positions and masks of a packed corpus ride the
    schedule's per-microbatch kwargs, so no corpus restriction applies.
    ``selective_ac`` / ``memory_budget_ac`` / ``region_ac`` are read only when
    ``activation_checkpoint`` names their mode (``'selective'`` /
    ``'memory_budget'`` -- which also requires ``compile=True`` -- or
    ``'region'``, which needs the optional ``torch_remat`` at apply time).
    Those AC arguments reach both paths through the one ``_apply_ac`` below,
    so the split path cannot checkpoint with a different policy than the
    unsplit one.

    Returns the (possibly wrapped) model -- or, with ``pp > 1``, a
    ``PipelineParallelSetup``: pipeline parallelism cuts the model into
    per-stage chunks, so there is no single module left to return. The two
