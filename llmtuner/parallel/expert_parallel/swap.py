"""Swap a HF MoE block for llmtuner's EP-capable MoE, weights included.

Every sparse decoder layer of a transformers 5.x MoE model holds the same block
under ``layer.mlp``: a router, plus two stacked expert parameters. Expert
parallelism needs those weights in grouped-GEMM form with a token dispatcher in
front -- the stack in ``models/common/`` (``GroupedExperts`` /
``TokenChoiceTopKRouter`` / ``MoE``). This module is the bridge: it detects the
HF block, moves the weights into the llmtuner layout, and replaces ``layer.mlp``.
It also flags the layer for the FSDP MoE branch (``layer.moe_enabled = True``
plus a non-registered ``layer.moe`` alias, as upstream's swap does), without
which the expert weights would be sharded as dense parameters over the dense
DP mesh. The swap is in place and dtype-preserving, so it must run before FSDP
wraps the model and after the weights are loaded.

Both halves of the block vary by family, and the probe is duck-typed against
structures rather than class names, which are not stable across transformers
releases:

* **The router.** ``block.gate`` or ``block.router``, either a plain
  ``nn.Linear`` (DeepSeek-V2) or a bespoke module holding the same ``(E, D)``
  weight plus, for DeepSeek-V3/GLM4, an ``e_score_correction_bias`` buffer.
  Identified by its *weight tensor*, not its type (``router_of``).
* **The expert weights.** Always ``gate_up_proj (E, 2F, D)`` and
  ``down_proj (E, D, F)``, split by ``chunk(2, dim=-1)`` after the gate+up
  GEMM. Identified by shape (``fused_experts_of``).

Where a family keeps its routing attributes also moved in 5.x: ``top_k``,
``n_group``, ``topk_group``, ``norm_topk_prob``, ``scoring_func`` and
``routed_scaling_factor`` now sit on the *block* for every family, having been
split between block and router in 4.x. Every ``_read_*`` helper therefore takes
both owners and prefers whichever declares the field.

Weight layout: HF stores each projection as ``(out, in)`` and applies it as
``x @ W.T``; ``GroupedExperts`` stores the same orientation per expert
(``w1_EFD``/``w3_EFD`` are ``(F, D)``, ``w2_EDF`` is ``(D, F)``) and applies it
with the same ``F.linear``. Moving a weight is therefore elementwise -- no
transpose, no regrouping -- except for the one split of ``gate_up_proj`` into
its gate and up halves. ``tests/unit_tests/cpu/parallel/test_ep_swap.py``
pins both halves of that claim against the HF block being replaced.

Routing parity with the HF block: Qwen3Moe and Mixtral score with a softmax over
fp32 logits; DeepSeek-V3/GLM4 score with a sigmoid and apply
``routed_scaling_factor``; DeepSeek-V2 scores with a softmax but never
renormalizes, whatever its config declares (see ``ignores_norm_topk_prob``).
``RouterGateLinear`` computes in fp32, so the same score function reproduces it,
and ``TokenChoiceTopKRouter`` takes node-limited routing as
``num_expert_groups``/``num_limited_groups``. The one deliberate addition is the
load-balance machinery HF never gets to run through this wrapper (the wrapper
never asks for router logits): the router carries a
``MicrobatchWiseLoadBalanceLoss`` with the config's ``router_aux_loss_coef``,
whose gradient is injected on backward (see ``models/common/aux_loss.py``).

Two families are deliberately *not* swapped, each because the HF block asks for
something the llmtuner stack does not express -- refusing beats approximating,
since the difference shows up only as different experts being chosen, which no
loss curve reveals:

* ``GPT-OSS``: per-expert bias vectors, a transposed ``(E, D, 2F)`` layout, and
  a hardcoded clamped sigmoid-GLU activation rather than a module
  (see ``fused_experts_of``).
* ``DeepSeek-V2`` with ``topk_method="group_limited_greedy"``: scores a group by
  its single best expert where V3/GLM4 sum the top-2 (see
  ``read_expert_groups``). Its default ``"greedy"`` is supported and exact.

``Qwen2Moe``'s ``shared_expert_gate`` multiplies where ``MoE.shared_experts``
only adds, and is refused at the point the shared expert is found.

    Args:
        model: a ``HFTransformerModel`` (anything exposing ``.layers``).
        ep_group: the EP process group. ``None`` (or a size-1 group is not
            special-cased -- pass ``None``) keeps all experts local and routes
            them with the reordering-only dispatcher; a multi-rank group
            shards the experts across it and routes with all-to-alls.
        router_aux_loss_coef: coefficient for the per-forward load-balance
            loss. ``None`` takes the HF config's ``router_aux_loss_coef``
            (Qwen3Moe has one; DeepSeek-V3's config has no such field and gets
            no loss). A float here overrides the config for every MoE layer.
        quantile_balancing: replace the sign-based load-balancing bias with
            quantile-balanced routing (``QuantileBalancedTopKRouter``): the
            bias is then re-solved from a required-bias histogram once per
            optimizer step instead of nudged by the sign rule, and
            ``load_balance_coeff`` is forced off. Requires sigmoid router
            scores and no group-limited routing.
        token_dispatcher: EP dispatch backend (``"alltoall"`` default,
            ``"torchao"`` optional-import adapter, ``"deepep"``/``"hybridep"``
            registered gaps refused here). See
            ``ParallelConfig.ep_token_dispatcher``.
        torchao_pad_multiple: padding multiple for the ``"torchao"`` backend.
        tp_enabled: the model is also tensor-parallelized (tp x ep). Used only
            for fail-fast validation of unverified combinations (currently a
            shared expert): the swap itself is layout-identical either way --
            the swapped block consumes and produces the T/tp sequence shard
            directly, which is the layout upstream's ep+sp MoE uses.

    Returns:
        The number of blocks swapped. Mixed sparse/dense models (e.g.
        Qwen3Moe's ``decoder_sparse_step``) swap only the sparse layers.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if no layer carries a recognizable HF MoE block. EP on a
            dense model is a config mistake, and silently swapping nothing
            would run it replicated.
        NotImplementedError: if a MoE block uses a layout this swap does not
            implement -- GPT-OSS's transposed, bias-bearing experts (see
            ``fused_experts_of``) or DeepSeek-V2's ``group_limited_greedy``
