"""EP-aware expert-state serialization for checkpoints.

The EP swap leaves expert weights as rank-heterogeneous tensors: each rank's
``GroupedExperts`` holds only its own ``num_local = E / ep`` experts, under the
same FQN every rank reports. A checkpoint backend that treats same-FQN tensors
as replicated collapses all ranks onto one expert slice, so EP runs refused
checkpointing outright (the retired ``ep_checkpoint`` matrix row).

The representation chosen here is the full-tensor one: on save, each expert
entry is all-gathered along the expert dim across the EP group into the
complete ``(E, F, D)`` / ``(E, D, F)`` tensor (upstream's logical view, where
the expert weight is one DTensor sharded on the EP axis); on load, every rank
slices its own ``[ep_rank * num_local, (ep_rank + 1) * num_local)`` piece back
out -- the same per-rank slicing the swap itself performs. Because the stored
tensor is the complete expert weight under the original FQN, a checkpoint is
independent of the EP degree: resuming with a different ``ep`` re-slices the
same full tensor.

Two value forms are handled:

* plain tensors (EP without FSDP): the live value is the local slice; gather
  concatenates, load narrows;
* ``DTensor`` (EP with FSDP2, experts sharded on the efsdp axis): the value is
  first materialized with ``full_tensor()`` per EP rank, then gathered; on
  load the slice is re-distributed with the live parameter's own mesh and
  placements so ``load_state_dict`` can copy it into the sharded parameter.

The transform applies to any flat, FQN-keyed dict: the model wrapper's (key
``fqn``), the optimizer container's (keys ``state.{fqn}.{state_name}`` -- the
shape match against the live parameter keeps scalar entries like ``step``
untouched), and the EMA's (``state.{fqn}.ema_params``).

Known cost: every save materializes the full expert weights on every rank
(and every load plans against them). That is the price of a degree-
independent, replication-safe layout; a sharded write plan is future work.
