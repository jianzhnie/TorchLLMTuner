"""Step 2: tensor parallelism -- declarative sharding realized by fused TP GEMMs.

A tensor-parallel projection is two separate things: WHERE its weight is cut, and
HOW its activations move around the cut. This file keeps those apart.

* ``ShardingConfig`` (built by the ``colwise()`` / ``rowwise()`` factories) is the
  DECLARATION -- plain data, no tensors, no collectives.
* ``ColumnParallelLinear`` / ``RowParallelLinear`` are the modules that REALIZE a
  declaration, built on the fused collective+GEMM primitives in ``linear.py``.
* ``apply_tp`` is the ENGINE -- it reads a plan (the model's HF ``tp_plan`` by
  default, or an explicit ``{pattern: ShardingConfig}`` map), cuts each target
  weight and swaps the projection out for its sharded module.

Weight layout, in the ``nn.Linear`` convention ``weight: [out_features,
in_features]``:

* ``colwise`` -- output features are split, i.e. the stored weight is cut on
  dim 0 into ``[out / tp, in]``. That is the ``w_shard_n = [N / R, K]`` contract
  ``AllGatherLinear`` documents: the op consumes the native layout and
  self-transposes inside the GEMM.
* ``rowwise`` -- input features are split, i.e. the stored weight is cut on dim 1,
  which is the layout ``LinearReduceScatter`` consumes as-is.

Activations stay sharded across the two: a column-parallel projection produces a
feature-sharded activation, which is exactly what the following row-parallel
projection consumes; the collectives are the sequence-parallel pair (all-gather
in, reduce-scatter out) fused into the GEMMs. This is the async-TP formulation,
not the older replicated-activation one -- the arithmetic is identical, but the
collective never materializes a full-sized activation and can overlap the matmul.

One site cannot host the fused gather: HF attention derives its q/k/v view
shapes from ``hidden_states.shape``, which a projection that physically
lengthens the sequence would silently mis-shape. Attention therefore takes the
same all-gather at the module boundary instead (``GatherSequenceFirst`` --
numerically identical, just unfused), its q/k/v projections become plain
feature-sharded GEMMs (``ColwiseLinearNoGather``), and its o_proj keeps the
fused reduce-scatter, which returns the activation to the sequence shard. The
MLP has no such shape derivation, so gate/up/down keep the fused realizers.

Scope: this is the mechanism. No meta-init (weights come from the HF model as
usual), no fused QKV (HF keeps q/k/v as separate projections), no FP8.
