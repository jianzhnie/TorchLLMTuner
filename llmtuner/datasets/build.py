"""Factory functions that turn configuration into a built object.

These sit one level above the modules whose classes they assemble, and that is
what they are for: ``loader.py`` and ``lr_scheduler.py`` hold one implementation
each and must not depend on their siblings, while a factory has to know all of
them. Building a dataloader means reading the recipe registry, constructing the
tokenizer, deriving the iteration policy and packing the graph -- four modules
whose only thing in common is that this function calls them.

The other direction is what does not belong here. A class that carries a builder
of its own suggests the data it produces is one of its fields, and for a config
it is not: ``DataloaderConfig`` is a parsed description, and building from it is
a separate act with its own arguments (which rank am I, how many tokens per
batch). Keeping them apart also keeps ``datasets/`` and ``components/`` free of
any reference back to ``trainer/``.

Same shape as ``components/optimizer/lr_scheduler.build_lr_scheduler``, which exists for
the same reason. Both take the whole run config and read their own fields off
it rather than taking those fields restated as loose scalars: a scalar restated
at the call site can drift from the field the config carries, and half of the
ones this used to take had already stopped being read at all.

    it, while the flat view on the same object supplies the scalars that go with
    it -- ``seed``, ``vocab_size``, ``global_batch_size``, ``max_seq_len``.

    ``dp_rank``/``dp_world_size`` say which slice of the corpus this process
    reads, and ``num_tokens_per_batch`` is the per-rank token count, matching
    torchtitan's ``num_tokens_per_microbatch_per_dp_rank``. The Grain loader
    divides every dataset's rows among ``dp_world_size`` ranks and hands each
    one exactly that many tokens, so the DP slice the trainer used to perform

    the pass. ``dataset`` overrides ``config.dataloader.dataset`` for that same
