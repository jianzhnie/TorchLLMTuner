"""The data iterator the training loop pulls micro-batches from.

Vendored in shape from torchtitan ``trainer.py:batch_generator``, and from the
``components/data`` contract it satisfies. What is kept is the *contract*, not
the data source:

* :class:`~llmtuner.datasets.loader.DataloaderExhaustedError` is raised, not
  swallowed. Running out of data
  mid-step cancels the whole step rather than training on a partial batch, so
  the training loop can catch it and stop cleanly.
* The iterator is infinite from the loop's point of view: a finite source is
  restarted, an empty one raises immediately rather than spinning forever.

What is not kept: llmtuner has no collator or ``max_num_documents`` here. The
source shipped in this module is synthetic random tokens; the real corpus lives
behind the Grain dataset graph in ``loader.py``. Both satisfy
:class:`~llmtuner.datasets.loader.BaseDataLoader`, so the training loop has one
path rather than two.
