"""Grain-backed dataloader.

Vendored from torchtitan ``components/data/loader.py``. Everything the loader
needs is a constructor argument: the already-built graph, the collator, the
iteration knobs, and the runtime objects -- the tokenizer, the DP extent -- that
no description can hold. There is no config dataclass in between, because a
config here would be a parameter bag built one line before its only consumer.

``GrainDataLoader``'s ``dataset`` is the already-built Grain graph, not something
this module constructs. The caller has the dataset registry, and building it
there is what keeps ``loader.py`` free of a dependency on every concrete dataset
-- which is also why :func:`~llmtuner.datasets.build.build_dataloader`, which does
own that registry, lives one level up.
