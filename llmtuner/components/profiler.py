"""Kineto traces and allocator memory snapshots, over one training run.

Vendored from torchtitan's ``observability/profiler.py``. The shape is kept: a
``Profiler`` that is entered once around the training loop and stepped once per
iteration, owning a torch profiler for traces and a ``MemoryProfiler`` for
periodic snapshots, plus the OOM path that forces a final snapshot before the
process dies.

The memory side is the part worth having even when traces are off: a run that
OOMs at step 400 leaves no evidence of what the allocator was holding, and the
exit snapshot is what answers that.

Departures from torchtitan, each a subtraction or a device-portability fix:

* **No ``structured_logger``.** The ``log_trace_span`` wrappers around
  ``profiler.step()`` go with it, which llmtuner does not have; a profiler step is
  already the finest thing the trace shows.

* **No ``active()`` builder.** torchtitan splits ``build`` (returns a configured
  profiler) from ``active`` (supplies the runtime step and folder), because a
  config there has to be buildable with no arguments. llmtuner constructs the
  ``Profiler`` where the trainer knows both, so they collapse into the
  constructor.

* **No CUDA-graph annotations.** Those annotate a trace with the module FQNs
  captured inside ``torch.cuda.graph`` regions. llmtuner does not capture CUDA
  graphs, so ``get_cudagraph_annotations`` could only ever return an empty dict
  and the version probe around ``export_chrome_trace`` guards a branch that
  cannot be taken.

* **The trace activities follow the resolved device.** ``cuda`` adds
  ``ProfilerActivity.CUDA`` and ``xpu`` adds ``ProfilerActivity.XPU``, which is
  upstream's branch pair; every other resolved device (``npu``, ``mlu``,
  ``musa``, ``cpu``) traces CPU work only, exactly as upstream does. This reads
  the device from ``accelerator/device.py`` rather than probing
  ``torch.cuda.is_available()``/``torch.xpu.is_available()``, so the trace
  describes the device the run is actually on.

* **Memory history is recorded through the device module, not ``torch``.** See
  ``utils/monitoring.record_memory_history`` -- torchtitan's non-CUDA
  branch calls ``torch.memory``, which does not exist.

One addition: the rank comes from ``utils/logger_utils``, so a single-process
run has a rank without a process group, the same way metrics does it.
