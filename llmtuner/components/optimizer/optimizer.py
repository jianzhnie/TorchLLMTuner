"""The optimizer container a run trains with, and the ``Stateful`` view over it.

Moved here from ``components/checkpointer/base.py``: neither the materialization
nor ``init_optim_state`` is checkpoint machinery. The materialization is an
optimizer operation the checkpointer happens to need, and the FQN re-keying is
the on-disk *format* of optimizer state, which is a property of the optimizer,
not of the thing writing it out.

Vendored from torchtitan's ``components/optimizer/optimizer.py``. The unit that
came across is ``OptimizersContainer``, driven by the training loop and handed
to the checkpointer.

* It owns one ``torch.optim.Optimizer`` per (model part, optimizer name) pair, so
  a run with pipeline parallelism and two optimizer types holds four inner
  optimizers. ``step`` / ``zero_grad`` fan out over them; ``state_dict`` /
  ``load_state_dict`` flatten them into one FQN-keyed dict, which is what makes
  a PP checkpoint unambiguous (see ``utils.get_flat_optim_state_dict``).
* One of its behaviors is load-bearing beyond its name: ``state_dict``
  **materializes** optimizer state first (``init_optim_state``, a zero-gradient,
  zero-lr step) before reporting it. PyTorch's ``Optimizer`` already satisfies
  ``Stateful``, so that is what makes this object usable as one -- a resumed run
  builds a fresh optimizer whose Adam moments do not exist until its first
  ``step()``, and DCP, handed an unmaterialized state dict, would find no
  ``exp_avg`` to write into and silently restart from a cold optimizer under
  warm weights.

Departures from upstream, subtractive except where noted:

* **No ``Configurable``.** torchtitan configs build themselves. llmtuner keeps
  every config in ``llmtuner.config``, so the container takes an
  ``OptimizerConfig`` and the trainer constructs it.
* **No ``DistMuon``.** torchtitan's factory table also offers ``DistMuon``,
  which is built on ``torchtitan.distributed.flex_shard``; llmtuner has no
  equivalent, so the table is ``Adam`` / ``AdamW``.
* **No bf16 optimizer states.** ``fused_opt_states_bf16`` and the
  materialize-in-bf16 pre-hook it needs are not ported; the implementation
  setting stops at ``fused`` / ``foreach`` / ``for-loop``.
* **``fused`` is resolved against the device.** torchtitan hands the flag
  straight to every param group; torch validates the device only for the
  ``fused=`` *argument*, so a per-group ``fused=True`` on a device with no fused
  Adam kernel is accepted at construction and dies on the first ``step()``
  (``NotImplementedError: aten::_fused_adamw_ ... 'CPU'``). Since ``fused`` is
  the config's default, that would make the default CPU run unusable. llmtuner
  asks torch which devices it ships the kernel for and falls back to the
  for-loop implementation elsewhere -- the flag is a kernel preference, and the
  two runnable kernels are bit-identical on CPU.
* **No ``optimizer_factory_kwargs_by_name``.** That hook exists for per-parameter
  compute metadata and communication bucket specs; nothing in llmtuner passes it.
* **``_validate_params`` raises ``ValueError``, not ``AssertionError``, and
  names the offending parameters.** An unclaimed trainable parameter is
  reachable from user config -- list explicit ``param_groups`` and forget the
  catch-all -- and the contract is that user-facing errors are ``ValueError``.
  A parameter left out and a parameter assigned twice are different mismatches
  with different fixes, which a pair of counts cannot tell apart.

    """One optimizer per (model part, optimizer name), driven as a single one.

    The training loop should not know how many optimizers exist, so this is
    itself an ``Optimizer``: ``step`` and ``zero_grad`` (the two methods the
    loop calls) fan out to the inner ones, and everything else -- gradient
    clipping, checkpointing -- reaches the parameters through ``param_groups``,
    which ``Optimizer.__init__`` merges across the inner optimizers.

    That merge is why ``_post_init`` exists rather than a plain assignment: the
    loop's ``clip_grad_norm_`` needs ``param_groups`` populated, and the step
    pre-hooks (MoE load balancing, the aux-loss roll-up) need the hook machinery
    that only ``Optimizer.__init__`` sets up. Calling it with an empty options
    dict gives both without registering any hyperparameters of its own.

    The number of inner optimizers follows from two independent splits:

    * one per **model part**, because each pipeline stage holds its own
      parameters. A run with pp=2 holds at least two, even when every parameter
      matches the same group -- which matters, because a step pre-hook fires once
      per ``step()`` call, i.e. once per container, not once per inner optimizer.
    * one per **optimizer name** within a part, because different parameter
      groups may name different optimizer classes.

    Parameters are matched to groups by regex against their FQN, first pattern
    wins; that is what lets norm and bias parameters take a different weight
    decay from the rest. A ``ValueError`` is raised if a pattern matches nothing
    (a typo'd pattern is otherwise a silent no-op) or if a trainable parameter
    ends up in no group at all.

    Args:
        config: the run's optimizer configuration. ``param_groups`` is the list
            of ``ParamGroupConfig`` patterns; ``implementation`` selects
            ``fused`` / ``foreach`` / ``for-loop`` for every inner optimizer.
