"""Online EMA of model weights, driven as a gradient-free pseudo-optimizer.

Vendored from torchtitan's ``components/optimizer/ema.py``. ``EMA`` subclasses
``OptimizersContainer`` -- it is never a real training optimizer -- to reuse its
flat, FQN-keyed, resharding-safe ``state_dict()``/``load_state_dict()``: the EMA
checkpoint key (``ema``) therefore has exactly the layout optimizer state
already follows (``state.{fqn}.ema_params``), which is what lets DCP reshard it
across world sizes with no bespoke format.

Semantics, kept from upstream:

* **Update.** On every firing, ``ema = decay * ema + (1 - decay) * param``,
  implemented as ``torch._foreach_lerp_(ema_params, params, 1 - decay)``.
* **Decay.** Either fixed (``decay``), or dynamic (the default): with
  ``num_updates`` the count of firings so far,
  ``decay = 2 ** (-1 / (half_life_fraction * num_updates))``, which keeps
  roughly the most recent ``half_life_fraction`` share of updates dominant.
  The count is *derived from the trainer step* rather than stored, so the
  schedule survives a checkpoint resume: only ``ema_params`` are checkpointed,
  and a stored counter would restart at 0, collapsing the decay to a full
  overwrite of the restored average on the first firing after a resume.
* **Tracked set.** Parameters with ``requires_grad`` at construction time, plus
  the floating-point buffers matched by ``buffer_patterns`` (e.g. an MoE's
  ``expert_bias_E``, updated by a non-gradient heuristic). The set is keyed by
  tensor identity and fixed at construction: a parameter or buffer that appears
  or is replaced afterwards raises rather than silently going unaveraged.
* **Cold start.** ``load_state_dict({})`` reseeds the average from the live
  model weights. The checkpointer calls this when a load restored the model
  but not the EMA (an ``exclude_from_loading=["ema"]`` load, or a model-only
  load), which is also the path for turning EMA on mid-run against a checkpoint
  that predates it.

Departures from upstream, all subtractions:

* **No ``Configurable``.** The knobs are explicit constructor arguments; their
  validation lives in ``llmtuner.config.EMAConfig``, where every llmtuner
  config lives, and the trainer passes the fields across.
* **No ``offload_to_cpu``.** Upstream's offload path is a CUDA side-stream
  H2D/D2H pipeline over pinned memory, tuned for GH200's NVLink-C2C. llmtuner
  runs CPU and NPU, has no use for it, and cannot exercise it in this
  environment, so it is not ported; the EMA tensors simply live where the
  parameters live. With it go the DTensor unwrap/rewrap dance at save/load --
  the inherited container state dict hands DCP the live ``ema_params`` tensors,
  which under FSDP2 are DTensors already.

            Measured in EMA firings, not raw steps. A normal resume needs no

            FQNs from ``model.named_buffers()``) selecting which buffers also
