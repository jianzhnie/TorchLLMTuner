"""The learning-rate schedule: linear warmup, stable phase, then decay.

Vendored from torchtitan ``components/optimizer/lr_scheduler.py``: the same
``LRSchedulersContainer``, driven by the same ``LambdaLR``, over the same
Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) curve (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06395).

The container is not optional. A ``LambdaLR`` reads ``lr`` off the first of its
optimizer's ``param_groups``, and an ``OptimizersContainer`` built the way the
loop needs it has none: its ``param_groups`` is the parameter view
``Optimizer.__init__`` merges, and no group carries an ``lr`` of its own. So the
scheduler has to be handed the *inner* optimizers, one ``LambdaLR`` each -- which
is exactly what this class holds, and why it exists rather than a bare
``LambdaLR``.

Departures from upstream:

* **The config is not defined here.** The knobs live in ``LRSchedulerConfig`` in
  ``llmtuner.config``, with every other config in the package;
  :func:`build_lr_scheduler` is the seam that turns one into the container.
  Upstream's ``Config.build`` is that seam, spelled with torchtitan's config
  system.
* **``state_dict`` reports ``last_epoch`` and nothing else.** ``LambdaLR`` is
  stateless apart from it -- the lr is a pure function of ``(last_epoch,
  base_lr)`` -- so ``_last_lr`` is recomputed on load rather than stored. The
  base lrs come back with the optimizer's own state. A stateful scheduler
  (``ReduceLROnPlateau`` and friends) would need more, which is why the load path
  spells this out instead of round-tripping the whole dict.
