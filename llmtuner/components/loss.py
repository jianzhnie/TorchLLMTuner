"""Loss functions: plain next-token CE, and its vocab-parallel form.

Vendored from torchtitan ``components/loss.py``. The arithmetic is unchanged.
The functions are called directly rather than through the ``BaseLoss`` /
``CrossEntropyLoss`` / ``MSELoss`` hierarchy, and the ``spmd.assert_type``
annotations are gone -- llmtuner configures by argument and checks shapes, not
SPMD types. Concretely, the vocab-parallel path is selected by comparing
``pred.shape[-1]`` with ``global_vocab_size`` rather than by upstream's
``spmd_mesh_size("tp") > 1``, which keeps a caller that has no SPMD context
working and cannot disagree with the tensors in front of it.

Two names here are llmtuner's rather than upstream's: ``next_token_targets`` and
``vocab_shard_bounds``. Nothing in torchtitan defines either. ``next_token_targets``
is the row-wise label shift the trainer applies; ``vocab_shard_bounds`` is the
bound formula lifted out of upstream's ``LossParallelCrossEntropy.forward`` so
the vocab-parallel embedding and the vocab-parallel loss cannot disagree about
which rank owns which token. ``IGNORE_INDEX`` is genuinely upstream.

Three entry points, and the difference between them is worth stating plainly:

* ``cross_entropy_loss`` -- the loss, with a sum reduction, so the caller can
  divide by a *global* token count once the per-rank counts have been reduced.
* ``chunked_lm_head_cross_entropy`` -- the same summed CE, run in sequence
  chunks so peak logits memory is bounded; it runs its own backward.
* ``compute_logprobs`` -- per-token log-probabilities, for inference-side use
  (GRPO, perplexity). Different job, mostly the same math.

    Materializing ``lm_head(hidden_states)`` costs ``T * V`` floats at once,
    which with a 150k vocabulary dwarfs the rest of the step. This splits the
    token axis into ``num_chunks`` pieces and runs ``lm_head`` + cross-entropy
    on one piece at a time, so the peak logits memory is ``T * V / num_chunks``
    (the accumulated gradients are ``T * H`` and ``V * H`` -- independent of
    the chunking).

    FSDP note: upstream wraps this loop with lm_head reshard/grad-sync
    management; llmtuner deliberately does not, so with an FSDP-sharded
    lm_head each chunk pays an extra all-gather/reduce-scatter round --
    a memory/latency cost, never a numerics difference. Merging that
    reshard management is a standalone performance item, not a gap.

    The function runs the backward ITSELF and returns the detached summed loss
    (un-normalized, the same sum reduction ``cross_entropy_loss`` uses). The
    backward is per chunk -- that is what keeps the peak low, since each
    chunk's logits are freed before the next chunk's are computed -- and each
    chunk's backward is scaled by ``grad_scale`` (the trainer passes
    ``1 / global_valid_tokens``), so the accumulated gradients equal those of
    ``(full_sum * grad_scale).backward()``. Chunking a sum and backwarding the
    pieces is exact: one chunk's logits gradient does not depend on any other
    chunk.

    Two rounds of backward happen: the per-chunk ones (which accumulate the
    lm_head weight gradient and each chunk's hidden-state gradient), then a
    single ``torch.autograd.backward(hidden_states, assembled_grads)`` that
    propagates the assembled ``T * H`` gradient through the decoder in one
    pass -- the decoder graph is traversed once, not once per chunk.

    Chunks need not divide the sequence: ``torch.chunk`` leaves a short final
    piece, and the sum reduction makes the split invisible to the value. Under
    CP/TP the hidden states are already a shard of the sequence along the
    token axis; chunking that local shard composes with the sum reduction the
    same way.

    ``tp_group`` / ``global_vocab_size`` are passed straight through to
    :func:`cross_entropy_loss`, so a vocab-sharded ``lm_head`` takes the
    vocab-parallel path per chunk and a replicated one takes the plain path --
    the selection is by shape, so the default (both ``None``, or a full-vocab
    head) is bit-for-bit the old behaviour.

    ``hidden_states`` must require grad -- this is a training path, and a
    silent no-backward would look like a working step.
