"""The DCP checkpoint manager: sharded I/O, async saving, HF export.

Vendored from torchtitan's ``components/checkpointer/dcp.py``. ``torch.distributed
.checkpoint`` is what this buys over ``torch.save``, and it buys two distinct
things:

* **A sharded layout.** Under FSDP each rank holds one shard of every parameter
  and only needs to write that shard; DCP records the global layout and stitches
  the shards back together on load. llmtuner's old ``torch.save``-per-rank format
  could not express that -- it happened to work only because every run it was
  used for had one rank owning the whole tensor.
* **Async saving and lazy loading.** ``async_save`` stages to host memory and
  writes from a background thread, so the next training step does not wait on
  disk. ``load`` reads into the live state dict in place, so a resumed run does
  not materialize a second copy of the model.

Two departures from torchtitan, both subtractions:

* **No ``structured_logger``.** torchtitan wraps saves in ``sl.log_trace_span``
  and reports the async write's duration as a structured scalar from a
  ``save_future`` callback. The spans go; the duration stays, as a
  ``logger.info`` line from the same callback.

* **No ``torchtitan.tools.filesystem``.** The local equivalent is
  ``checkpointer/filesystem``, which has the same API for the paths this module
  uses. The one difference is deliberate: llmtuner's ``rmtree`` mirrors
  ``shutil.rmtree(..., ignore_errors=True)`` for local paths, so a purge of an
  already-deleted directory is a no-op rather than a ``FileNotFoundError`` in
  the purge thread.

``AsyncMode.DISABLED`` is the default here, matching torchtitan.

    Note on Pipeline Parallelism and Virtual Stages:

    1. Even for simple PP schedules there is a separate optimizer per PP rank.
       Rank 0's optimizer has a ``param_group[0]`` referring to ``layers.0`` of
       the original model; rank 1's *also* has a ``param_group[0]``, since the
       index is positional, but referring to ``layers.1``. When saving, these
       collide and one of them is lost. Then on reload only one stage can restore
       its optimizer state and the others error.

       The solution is keying optimizer state by FQN instead of position. The
       ``OptimizersContainer`` does this unconditionally -- it has to, since one
       container already spans every model part, so there is no positional
       format for it to fall back to. torchtitan's container does the same.

    2. With complex PP schedules there are multiple model chunks per PP rank,
       which compounds (1) by also requiring us to reason about multiple local
       ``optim`` objects. ``ModelWrapper`` flattens the state dicts from each
       chunk into one before saving or loading, relying on the individual
       state dicts not to collide -- guaranteed for the model by correct
       pipeline splitting, and for the optimizer by the FQN keying in (1).

    3. LR schedulers index model state like optimizers do, so they are flattened
       the same way, under the assumption that all of them share a state dict.

    Args:
        config: how checkpointing is configured for this run.
        model_parts: the model chunks to checkpoint (one entry per PP stage).
        optimizer: the optimizer to checkpoint, as an ``OptimizersContainer``.
            Its state dict is flat and FQN-keyed, and it materializes a fresh
            optimizer's state before DCP plans the load.
        lr_scheduler: the lr schedule to checkpoint, as an
            ``LRSchedulersContainer``. Required: its ``last_epoch`` is the only
            thing that makes a resumed run continue the curve rather than
            restart it, and nothing else in the checkpoint carries it -- the
            optimizer restores ``base_lrs`` but not the step count. Registering
            it here also keeps it ordered after the optimizer, which it must be:
            ``load_state_dict`` writes ``base_lrs`` into the optimizers.
        ema: online EMA of model weights (``components.optimizer.EMA``), or
            None when the run has not configured one. Registered under the
            ``ema`` key; on a load that restores the model but not the EMA, the
            average is cold-started from the just-loaded weights.
        states: extra states to save beyond the model and optimizer.
        folder: absolute directory the checkpoints live in. Already joined with
            the run's dump folder by the caller.
        sd_adapter: converts model state dicts between the native layout and
            another format (HF safetensors). ``builder`` always passes
            ``HFTransformerStateDictAdapter``; passing none rejects the HF
            export paths at construction.
