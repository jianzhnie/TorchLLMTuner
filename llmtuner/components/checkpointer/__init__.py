"""Checkpointing: the manager contract, and the backends that implement it.

Ported from torchtitan's ``components/checkpointer/``. Three layers:

* ``base`` -- the contract (``BaseCheckpointManager``) plus the policies every
  backend shares: retention, step discovery, async draining, load selection.
  Nothing here knows how bytes are written.
* ``dcp`` -- ``CheckpointManager``, backed by ``torch.distributed.checkpoint``.
  This is the one llmtuner runs. It shards under FSDP, saves asynchronously, and
  loads in place.
* ``torch_checkpointing`` -- ``TorchCheckpointingManager``, backed by the
  ``torch_checkpointing`` package. That package is not a llmtuner dependency and
  is not installed in the development environment, so this module imports (its
  backend imports are deferred) but constructing the manager raises
  ``ImportError`` with an install hint. Not ported for completeness alone: it is
  the third of torchtitan's backends, and installing the package is the only
  step needed to use it.

``checkpoint_keys`` also holds ``canonical_fqn``, which strips the activation-checkpoint
wrapper segment from an FQN.

State keys. A checkpoint is keyed by the top-level names in ``base``: ``model``,
``optimizer``, ``lr_scheduler``, ``dataloader``, ``train_state``, ``ema``.
llmtuner fills in the first two plus whatever the caller passes in ``states``:

* ``model`` -- a ``ModelWrapper`` over the model chunks.
* ``optimizer`` -- the ``OptimizersContainer`` itself, passed through. It is
  already a ``Stateful`` whose state dict is flat and FQN-keyed, which is what
  DCP needs to reshard a pipeline checkpoint, and it materializes a fresh
  optimizer's Adam moments before DCP plans a load.
* ``train_state`` -- the ``Trainer`` itself. torchtitan's ``Trainer`` is a
  ``Stateful`` exposing ``step`` and ``ntokens_seen``; llmtuner's trainer exposes
  the same two through ``state_dict``/``load_state_dict`` for the same reason:
  they are the counters a resumed run needs.
* ``lr_scheduler`` -- the ``LRSchedulersContainer`` from
  ``components/optimizer/lr_scheduler.py``, always registered. It holds one
  integer, ``last_epoch``, that nothing else in the checkpoint carries: the
  optimizer restores the ``base_lrs`` so the *current* lr comes back right, but
  the step count is the scheduler's own, and a resumed run's fresh scheduler
  starts it at 0. Without it the curve restarts on the step after a resume --
  invisible while the lr is constant, wrong for the rest of the run once warmup
  or decay is set.
* ``dataloader`` -- the ``BaseDataLoader``, registered only when it is loadable.
  See the trainer's ``build_dataloader`` for why the synthetic one is not.
* ``ema`` -- the ``EMA`` pseudo-optimizer from
  ``components/optimizer/ema.py``, registered only when the run configures one
  (``training.ema_config``). Its state dict is the same flat, FQN-keyed layout
  as optimizer state. A load that restores the model but not this key -- an
  ``exclude_from_loading=["ema"]`` load, or any model-only load -- cold-starts
  the average from the just-loaded weights (see ``dcp.CheckpointManager``).
