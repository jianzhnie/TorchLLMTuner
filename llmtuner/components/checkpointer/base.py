"""The checkpoint contract: what a checkpoint holds, and the policies over it.

Vendored from torchtitan's ``components/checkpointer/base.py``. The class
structure is kept -- a backend-agnostic ``BaseCheckpointManager`` with the
shared policies (retention, step discovery, async draining, load selection) and
concrete subclasses that only implement how bytes are read and written -- because
that split is what makes the DCP and torch_checkpointing managers share 90% of
their logic in torchtitan, and it is what will let llmtuner do the same.

Four deliberate departures, all subtractions:

* **The config is not defined here.** torchtitan's ``BaseCheckpointManager``
  carries its own nested config, which is what keeps a manager's defaults next
  to the manager. llmtuner keeps all configuration in one module
  (``llmtuner.config``), so the managers take an explicit ``config``
  argument of the type defined there.

* **No tyro.** ``purge_exempt`` was
  ``Annotated[Function.Config | None, tyro.conf.Suppress]`` -- a CLI-suppressed
  pluggable predicate. It is typed as a plain ``Callable[[int], bool] | None``
  here; nothing parses it off a command line.

* **No ``structured_logger`` spans.** torchtitan wraps load/save in
  ``sl.log_trace_span`` and stamps ``sl.add_step_tag``. llmtuner has no structured
  logger; the ``logger.info`` lines that carry the same information are kept.

* **``GarbageCollection`` is local.** torchtitan's version carries
  structured-logger tags in ``run``; llmtuner's ``utils/gc.py`` keeps the
  collection and drops the tags. Its ``run`` is likewise not wired into the
  training loop yet -- the checkpointer uses only ``collect``.

``MODEL`` / ``OPTIMIZER`` / ``LR_SCHEDULER`` / ``DATALOADER`` / ``TRAIN_STATE``
are the top-level state keys a checkpoint is keyed by. llmtuner shares none of
torchtitan's component containers, so which of them a run actually populates
differs -- see ``components/checkpointer/__init__.py`` for the mapping.

The ``Stateful`` views a checkpoint wraps its inputs in -- ``ModelWrapper`` here,
and the ``OptimizersContainer`` itself on the optimizer side -- are not part of
this contract: they are what a model or an optimizer looks like *to* a
checkpointer, and they live with the thing they wrap. This module keeps the
model one only because a model has no other home.

    Serves two purposes:

    1. **Flattening.** Combines the state dicts of several modules (individual

       checkpointing code interacts with them through a single interface.
    2. **Stable-storage caching.** Caches the flattened state dict and, on every
       ``state_dict()`` call, returns tensors backed by the *same* storage.
       Async DCP staging may cache pinned host buffers keyed by the source
       storage, so keeping storage stable lets it reuse those buffers across
       saves -- this is the fast checkpoint path. Parameter tensors already
       satisfy this, since the cached view shares the parameter's storage.
       Tensors produced by module ``state_dict`` hooks (one that splits a fused
       parameter, say) may be freshly allocated each call, so they are refreshed
       in place: their storage stays put while their values track the parameters.

        - ``load_state_dict`` updates the underlying modules and refreshes the
